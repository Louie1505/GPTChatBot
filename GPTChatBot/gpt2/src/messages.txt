oh, file transfer protocol
<|endoftext|>
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files between a client and server on a computer network.  FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.[1] FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it

watching something niall, message when you're coming on
<|endoftext|>
5 mins darlings, or whenever niall comes back
<|endoftext|>
ho
<|endoftext|>
oh yeah, i won the civ match like 25 turns after you left
<|endoftext|>
i took his capital and held it for a few turns so josch surrenders before the game got stale
<|endoftext|>
sounds fun, michael said he wants to play at some point. watching the speeches from yesterday...
<|endoftext|>
oh yeah and gabriel has it too
<|endoftext|>
cool, id be up for it any time
<|endoftext|>
ok cool
<|endoftext|>
his victory speech is so different to every other one in his campaign
<|endoftext|>
yeah, i've been bringing it up to people
<|endoftext|>
he seems so mellow
<|endoftext|>
a victory for the people and all that
<|endoftext|>
very strange. i hope this is the trump we see for the next 4 years, maybe he'll do as little damage as possible.
<|endoftext|>
yeah, hes been like it since monday
<|endoftext|>
i hope he does bad enough to embarass himself and make people vote left but not bad enough to do any lasting damage
<|endoftext|>
Bernie would've won against him, the election was a choice between a corportate puppet or a loose canon who leads a corporation
<|endoftext|>
clinton promised nothing, trump pormised change - however warped that change is
<|endoftext|>
i think he would have won even more of the popular vote, i'm not sure he would have won
<|endoftext|>
it would have been a vote between sensible solidarity and a maveric mad-man
<|endoftext|>
i suppose, and all of the people who just refused to vote for a woman would have been more torn
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
poor mancunian farmers are lossing there land
<|endoftext|>
homes displaced for under market value
<|endoftext|>
yeah look at all the land those pillars are going to take up
<|endoftext|>
i'm sure that'll make a huge difference
<|endoftext|>
the route has chamged slightly so a bunch of new acres of land between sheffield and manc are being used
<|endoftext|>
more homes are being bought out from under people for less then market rate
<|endoftext|>
im not against the rail and i know the route has to be there for a reason
<|endoftext|>
but they are fucking people over on buy-outs
<|endoftext|>
hace been doing so for the last few years now
<|endoftext|>
people can choose not to move if they own their houses, clearly they're happy enough with the prices
<|endoftext|>
there houses get taken by the gov and the prices are below market value on over 70% of those moved
<|endoftext|>
they dont get a choice
<|endoftext|>
if you own your house then you have a choice
<|endoftext|>
no they'rer being forced
<|endoftext|>
whole streets are being taken
<|endoftext|>
that's your property, they can't just take it. if it's council housing then that's different but they can go get jobs and buy a house if they want a choice
<|endoftext|>
do you know any good software to remap keys on windows? i can't find any that do what i want them to do
<|endoftext|>
there are a few macro key function websites, i haven't used them since high school
<|endoftext|>
ask ecclces, they can be useful for wow
<|endoftext|>
i want to rebind the number row to the symbols because it's annoying when programming to have to press shift and i have a numpad for the actual numbers that i use anyway
<|endoftext|>
i dont know any but there are a few out there, just account for latency when in use
<|endoftext|>
most do it through the registry so there shouldn't be any, but most see each key so i can bind to  1/! but not to 1 or to !
<|endoftext|>
possible to intall one that jumps into action after the input is through and changes it
<|endoftext|>
yeah, i'll keep looking, think i may be able to do it in the console
<|endoftext|>
think i've done it
<|endoftext|>
!"¬£
<|endoftext|>
works on everything except discord
<|endoftext|>
fuck, i have to bind all the rest of the keys to what they usually are, nly the symbols work now
<|endoftext|>
although discord seems to use its own keyboard profile
<|endoftext|>
!"¬£$%^&*()
<|endoftext|>
!"¬£$%^&*()
<|endoftext|>
some things are so hard to do on windows for no reason
<|endoftext|>

so net neutrality and privacy aren't things in this country anymore
<|endoftext|>
good thing we got out of europe though
<|endoftext|>
was really holding us back
<|endoftext|>
non neutralitty is illegal
<|endoftext|>
not anymore! üòÑ
<|endoftext|>
what?
<|endoftext|>
new law that's intended to "stop underage eyes from viewing pornographic material", but basically undermines all concepts behind net neutrality. the government now have the power to tell an isp to block any site, without a court hearing or anything, and the scope of the legislation is so wide that they could technically make reddit illegal overnight
<|endoftext|>
but connection speed manipulating is still illegal?
<|endoftext|>
i suppose it's less analogue now, we either have access or not. oh and by the way, gchq and military intelligence got basically unlimited monitoring powers the other day and nobody even batted a fucking eyelid
<|endoftext|>
the gov likes putting sketchy deals thro when the media eyes are elsewhere (on trump) its how the 'snooper charter' got put through
<|endoftext|>
it's not even sketchy at this point, we're one of the few countries without a constitution but if this were anywhere else it would violate every law in there and the leading party would be sued to shit
<|endoftext|>
how's ttip (havent heard it in ages)

<|endoftext|>
piece of shit game
<|endoftext|>
No
<|endoftext|>
it's a rendered film where you walk along a path and kill the things it puts in front of you. not a game.
<|endoftext|>
I see what you tried to do
<|endoftext|>
you failed

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
ITS hard for you to understand
<|endoftext|>
:fedodo:
<|endoftext|>
it isn't a fun fucking game, if you took out the cutscenes and just played the game with no audio then you'd turn it off out of boredom in 5 minutes. go watch a tv show/film if you want something that only exists for story/cinematography
<|endoftext|>
why would you play a game without audio
<|endoftext|>
deaf people play games too
<|endoftext|>
deaf people watch shows too
<|endoftext|>
*disappointed look in philip's eyes*
<|endoftext|>
i guess its a matter of preference
<|endoftext|>
i'm not saying you should play it without audio, i'm saying that a game, an interactive experience, should not be entertaining based solely on the writing and perfomance. that isn't a game, that's an animated film that you get to walk in
<|endoftext|>
but you called it a "piece of shit game"
<|endoftext|>
it is, because it's not fun as a game.
<|endoftext|>
walking along a path and shooting the things placed in front of you to get to the next cutscene is not fun. that's why COD isn't fun, and the only thing seperating the two is that TLOU has a good story and doesn't look like an 8 year old drew it. still not a game though
<|endoftext|>
so are you saying that all the campaigns in all games arent games?
<|endoftext|>
no, because most good games are fun to control and offer some sort of challenge or have interesting mechanics
<|endoftext|>
its mechanics are fine, like a better and more realistic GearsofWar
<|endoftext|>
plus stealth
<|endoftext|>
fuck yourself, that game plays itself
<|endoftext|>
it may drag a bit but story carries. Alot of people said it's too easy
<|endoftext|>
exactly, story shouldn't carry a game
<|endoftext|>
im unsure if there's ingame difficulty settings, but if so then turn it up
<|endoftext|>
(plus great multiplayer)
<|endoftext|>
(when it existed after launch)
<|endoftext|>
its your preference not fact
<|endoftext|>
there are plentyl of story driven games btw
<|endoftext|>
it's not preference that your game is shitty if the only good thing about it is the story
<|endoftext|>
and they're all bad at being games
<|endoftext|>
I strongly Disagree
<|endoftext|>
ok but you're not raising an argument, you're just disagreeing with me
<|endoftext|>
games are an art medium
<|endoftext|>
you are not giving facts mate
<|endoftext|>
there is plenty of ways to make one
<|endoftext|>
you are just giving opinions
<|endoftext|>
-play mad world
<|endoftext|>
Added Mad World - Gary Jules to the queue.
<|endoftext|>
i'm reallt not, i suppose it's an opinion that the game isn't enjoyable, but it isn't an opinion that a game that doesn't play well is a bad game. it may still be an enjoyable experience (it's not but that's subjective) but it's objectively a bad game. also niall, games can have an amazing story and that can add to the experience so much (bioshock, dark souls) but if that's the only thing that your game hangs on then it's barely even a game, let alone a good game
<|endoftext|>
you can have a story driven game
<|endoftext|>
did you even play the dame?

i have played it rod. how is that a good game though? it's a good experience, but it's not fun to play without the story
<|endoftext|>
The last of us does not lack in game mechanics at all. Its got a Fantastic storyline which you are claiming is the only  good thing about it. Thats not True. The storyline may cast a huge shadow over the rest of the gameplay but that does not make the game bad what so ever
<|endoftext|>
it doesn't amke the game bad, it's the only thing that saves that game. it is not fun to play
<|endoftext|>
Mechanics are prettty normal, there is nothing uniquely good or bad about them. bow is cool tho.

<|endoftext|>
oh, tomb raider has puzzles and psudo horror/exploration
<|endoftext|>
the 2013 one was way better, this one was just a cinematic piece
<|endoftext|>
its fighting mechanics are a lever to progress the story and add tension
<|endoftext|>
but it had fun and beautiful parts

major let down
<|endoftext|>
fair
<|endoftext|>
wb that cool camera he gets though, didn't that just make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?
<|endoftext|>
he could have just bought it himself, her sticking with the semi-asshole removes the good about it
<|endoftext|>
i know they tried to redeem him
<|endoftext|>
but the stuff he did means he's an asshole underneath
<|endoftext|>
true
<|endoftext|>
the other guy was poor and ugly though so what did you expect her to do?
<|endoftext|>
pity fuck
<|endoftext|>
you don't know she didn't
<|endoftext|>
i found him cool enough (muscles in the first episodes, hubahuba), and she was meant to be an ex-nerd
<|endoftext|>
he wasn't as pretensious as they made out
<|endoftext|>
i 100% agree with you btw, i'm just messing
<|endoftext|>
also the voyeurism scene was some of the best tv ever
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
who?
<|endoftext|>
oh wait i got it
<|endoftext|>

nah, videos man. totally different
<|endoftext|>
oh and

idk, compatability or something? is it working for your stream 'friends'?

try deleting the game. don't bother reinstalling it

launching it repeatedly won't help, sounds like it just launched broken
<|endoftext|>
im doing it different each time
<|endoftext|>
how do you delete dlc? i seem to be disabling but not removing?
<|endoftext|>
don't think you can, you have to disable then reinstall the game (i think)

delete local content?

The national flag of Zimbabwe consists of *seven even horizontal stripes of green, gold, red and black* with a white triangle containing a red 5-pointed star with a Zimbabwe Bird. The present design was adopted on 18 April 1980, when Zimbabwe won its independence from the United Kingdom.

where do you find drivers in win10?
<|endoftext|>
what driver are you looknig for
<|endoftext|>
which
<|endoftext|>
that's super complicated, what's happening?
<|endoftext|>
wifi adapter driver
<|endoftext|>
the forced win10 updates keep fucking up
<|endoftext|>
need to role back driver update
<|endoftext|>
it fucked up my sound driver before too
<|endoftext|>
yeah thats one of the three probs lately
<|endoftext|>
wifi and sound drivers then random black screens
<|endoftext|>
you can't roll a driver update back, just spread yourself open wider while windows 10 fucks you. you could try uninstalling the driver (advanced properties for that device in hardware list) then redownloading and forcing it (google)
<|endoftext|>
found it but win10 hides all security password needed options in control panel
<|endoftext|>
disable that, you should find it with win+R then searching
<|endoftext|>
Omg. Sherlock just killed it.

<|endoftext|>
i watched a 30min doc about hackers, this one came up  alot, it made a chinese hacker cry
<|endoftext|>
he sounds like a little bitch
<|endoftext|>
it got cracked for games that were already out
<|endoftext|>
he was from very prestigious hacker group who gave you DS3
<|endoftext|>
ds3 wasn't denuvo, and he was 3dm
<|endoftext|>
ik, but his group were the ds3 distibutors
<|endoftext|>
it was cracked immediately by many groups, i had 2 versions within a day (one for mods, the other was harder to mod but ran better and had some online)
<|endoftext|>
that mod is fucking massive...rod popped in for like 30 seconds
<|endoftext|>
hot

*Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly followed by the arrival of the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows*

<|endoftext|>
*The Cat leaves just before their mother arrives*
<|endoftext|>

steam greenlight is getting shut down this year
<|endoftext|>
good riddance
<|endoftext|>
fair. apparently you'll have to pay $500-2000  and fill  in paperwork and it'll be approved
<|endoftext|>
makes alot more sense
<|endoftext|>
i suppose, as long as $500 is enough to keep the shittiest things off the platform
<|endoftext|>
i guess they can vary it if it isn't
<|endoftext|>
although is in the kind of range of a practical joke by 30 somthing yearolds
<|endoftext|>
especially if theres more than one
<|endoftext|>
yeah that's what i thoguht, if i could afford it then 500 is well worth a joke
<|endoftext|>
so in other news, the game does run on my laptop
<|endoftext|>
well?
<|endoftext|>

Hello

@Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
bye then mike
<|endoftext|>
I'm on a train currently so having to hide screen .
<|endoftext|>
lol... in other news eccles got fisted on the 722 as tim and me watched from then next bus
<|endoftext|>
i'll remove it
<|endoftext|>
i'm sorry?
<|endoftext|>
she wasn't and eccled seemed to love it. harrison liked to watch too
<|endoftext|>
webbles@hotmail.com
<|endoftext|>
@Ebon this true?
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505 ??
<|endoftext|>
so i wanted your opinion on something
<|endoftext|>
Mmm hmm...?
<|endoftext|>
so, hypothetically, let's say that one of our friends (we'll call him neil) has recently asked out a girl (we'll call her eve), and another friend  has been somewhat part of a conversation in which eve has described hers and niall's relationship to someone we know (read eddie) as "strictly platonic" and "just friends". in those circumstances, would his friends who know have any moral obligation to tell him?
<|endoftext|>
well thank you for now including me into these hypothetical friends
<|endoftext|>
i have no clue
<|endoftext|>
maybe wait until he goes on the 'date'
<|endoftext|>
also (read eddie)?
<|endoftext|>
but the danger then is that this is information he will find out on this date, and we can prevent him from being in that situation, or at least allow him to make an informed decision
<|endoftext|>
medhi
<|endoftext|>
why would she have said yes in the first place then?
<|endoftext|>
it was in front of people and just pity
<|endoftext|>
i mean no one likes to kick puppys but sometimes thats whats required
<|endoftext|>
surely thats worse for her though...?
<|endoftext|>
of course but what do we do about naill
<|endoftext|>
like now she seems like she's interested and all her friends now know too
<|endoftext|>
i suppose, but is this not information he should be allowed to consider with all of the facts available to him?
<|endoftext|>
maybe she was being teased by someone and said 'just friends' to get them off her back?
<|endoftext|>
rod is indecisive
<|endoftext|>
maybe, medhi isn't really like that
<|endoftext|>
*eddie
<|endoftext|>
maybe not eddie but someone else was teasing?
<|endoftext|>
think it was just them
<|endoftext|>
do we even know exactly what went down when he asked her out?
<|endoftext|>
she said yes and reassured him about being awkward and then he did the weird embarassing celebration in front of her and then he suggested like 2 days and she said she was busy to both and she suggested half term
<|endoftext|>
from my understanding
<|endoftext|>
was it infront of people?
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
i dunno
<|endoftext|>
great, exactly the answer rod gave
<|endoftext|>
have you asked lauren?
<|endoftext|>
she unquestioningly said we should tell him
<|endoftext|>
and is watching this
<|endoftext|>
I think do it
<|endoftext|>
i guess its up to him to decide how to intrepret the information
<|endoftext|>
he cant get annoyed at you if he still goes and its super crushing
<|endoftext|>
that's true. ok, i'll tell him tomorrow and prefix it with stuff about being rational. i'll be very gentle
<|endoftext|>
sensual even
<|endoftext|>
loving
<|endoftext|>
delicate
<|endoftext|>
you are *totally* the type
<|endoftext|>
what type?
<|endoftext|>
the sensual, loving, delicate type
<|endoftext|>
true
<|endoftext|>
what?
<|endoftext|>
definity not
<|endoftext|>
was more of a handjob
<|endoftext|>
@Misery  Do you know which comdoms to buy?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Banana skins
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
sorry
<|endoftext|>
too cruel that  even for me
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
i dont understand why i should take offence
<|endoftext|>
so im offended
<|endoftext|>
alright The Internet, relax
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
:rodtaylorsmallhq3x:

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
i guess maybe his exam is just really long
<|endoftext|>
idk when he started
<|endoftext|>
oh wait, i saw him at about 11 so 11:30 would make sense, so maybe he isn't done until 1
<|endoftext|>
His exam starts at 11ish
<|endoftext|>
??
<|endoftext|>
idk, it must have been either 11 or 11:30 though
<|endoftext|>
you can come over whever btw and wait here, i'm gonna go cook now
<|endoftext|>
I come over after i get some lunch
<|endoftext|>
Btw will jackbox party pack work with your phone?
<|endoftext|>

William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, OM, GCVO, PC, FRS, FRSE (/Ààk…õlv…™n/; 26 June 1824 ‚Äì 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish[1][2] mathematical physicist and engineer who was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. He also had a career as an electric telegraph engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth, fame and honour. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was knighted in 1866 by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William Thomson. He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on the mariner's compass, which had previously been limited in reliability.

I have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the house for a few weeks now I have a few questions about this issue as I am not sure if you have a good idea of what you are looking for in this category you will find a list of hotels in London please visit our website for further information and information about the services we provide for your business
<|endoftext|>

The first thing I would like to know if you have any problems with the other side of this website and it will take a while to get back to the UK and have been in touch with the right person for the role and the role of the organisation in which the company is looking for the best car hire deals in the UK from here to find out more about the role of the project in which you have been looking for a new car and the other side of the screen is not compatible with the Samsung mobile device for a long period of time if you have a good idea of how much you can save money from the UK and abroad for sale in the UK and Europe and the UK and Ireland and the UK and the world of business with a great range of flowers and gifts to our florists in Australia

probably safe to assume mid to end of june
<|endoftext|>
ok yeah, sounds about right
<|endoftext|>
exam times are back up if you want an exact date
<|endoftext|>
oh nice, cheers
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
mr clancy's fun time
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
yeah, what he said, i agree
<|endoftext|>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRMZXGSBvQ
<|endoftext|>
think kf2 is worth it?
<|endoftext|>
of all the videos you could have sent that has to be one of the most annoying
<|endoftext|>
also it kinda just looks like a remake of kf but with better graphics
<|endoftext|>
yeah it pretty much it, and nialldefo couldn't run it
<|endoftext|>
yep
<|endoftext|>
probably not worth it atm then
<|endoftext|>
looks like fun but ultimately fun that can easily be had in the original
<|endoftext|>
yeah, that's true
<|endoftext|>
lucky cunt
<|endoftext|>
got it booted? i assume you'll want to play something stupidly intensive later, see them frames
<|endoftext|>
Any suggestions?
<|endoftext|>
see if you and you alone can run arkham knight
<|endoftext|>
ha wasn't that game the one which was so broken basically no one could play it
<|endoftext|>
even with dual titans
<|endoftext|>
it was
<|endoftext|>
yeah i think not
<|endoftext|>
play something and make me hard with those frame numbers?
<|endoftext|>
oh, you could try re7  on max. it scales very well
<|endoftext|>
i dont have re7
<|endoftext|>
torrent, then try and beat 10 hours dead
<|endoftext|>
not a very fast time but it's the best i could do ok
<|endoftext|>
Thoes low fps slowing down
<|endoftext|>
i get 60, just can't play on max
<|endoftext|>
i was staying above 60 in witcher 3 completly maxed out (with hairworks too)
<|endoftext|>
impressive
<|endoftext|>
but i cba playing that game
<|endoftext|>
bc it's bad
<|endoftext|>
i have no idea how to play anymore or what i was doing or anything
<|endoftext|>
bad game
<|endoftext|>
Currently running ungine heaven benchmark
<|endoftext|>
hot
<|endoftext|>
like 4x max fps
<|endoftext|>
didn't even break 70C
<|endoftext|>
i mean i don't break 55 but
<|endoftext|>
Errm i dont believe you
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
told you. exercise in mediocrity
<|endoftext|>
Want to play something?
<|endoftext|>
can join sanctum in a few if you want
<|endoftext|>
of all the things you could have picked
<|endoftext|>
it's not bad, i'm doing the campaign now
<|endoftext|>
i never said it was bad just that its not the most riveting game ive ever played
<|endoftext|>
you mean it's not intensive and you want to brag about those frames
<|endoftext|>
not really i just don't fancy playing it right now
<|endoftext|>
ok bb, what would you like to play
<|endoftext|>
minecraft?
<|endoftext|>
could do
<|endoftext|>
you dowloaded it? i'm done, can launch now
<|endoftext|>
sorry had to go eat
<|endoftext|>
not sure you has to
<|endoftext|>
no i did
<|endoftext|>
which version of minecraft did you get?
<|endoftext|>
starve. it's an updater, latest one
<|endoftext|>
??
<|endoftext|>
currently 1.11.2
<|endoftext|>
it's just going to be the most recent version
<|endoftext|>
oh shit i just realised you were refering to my eating habbits
<|endoftext|>
i thought starve was some mod for minecraft i hadn't heard of
<|endoftext|>
no haha, i just want you to die of a lack of eating
<|endoftext|>
are we not doing modded then
<|endoftext|>
up to you, we can
<|endoftext|>
what mods would you like to use?

later, i really should get some work done, i haven't done any over half term yet
<|endoftext|>
alright
<|endoftext|>
is my loreto down?
<|endoftext|>
appears to be. we didn't get an email, maybe another power cut
<|endoftext|>
ffs
<|endoftext|>
what do you need it for?
<|endoftext|>
i need my email
<|endoftext|>
you don't have it forwarding to your normal email address?
<|endoftext|>
nope
<|endoftext|>
should probably do that, first thing i did last yeah
<|endoftext|>
year
<|endoftext|>
thats just annoying, mixing inboxes
<|endoftext|>
you can have it go to a seperate folder
<|endoftext|>
i need files from there to work though
<|endoftext|>
thats a shame
<|endoftext|>
really is
<|endoftext|>
guess i have to play overwatch
<|endoftext|>
thats weird my delete key just stoped working
<|endoftext|>
that is wrird. try unplug keyboard
<|endoftext|>
nope
<|endoftext|>
damn must be broken
<|endoftext|>
yeah, guess so
<|endoftext|>
okay so thats even more interesting: my delete key works when combined with ctrl but not on its own
<|endoftext|>
in what software isn't it working? try just a word doc
<|endoftext|>
the plot thickens, it doesn't even work in software (onscreen keyboard)
<|endoftext|>
see what keyboard you're currently using, i can't remember the shortcut to switch but you may have hit it by accident, it's an easy one to mistake
<|endoftext|>
so rebooting seems to have fixed it, *weird*
<|endoftext|>
yeah i think you changed keyboards, bebotting switches you to default
<|endoftext|>
rebooting
<|endoftext|>
where da rod at?
<|endoftext|>
mmm i love to bebott
<|endoftext|>
Huh?

Milk for Free A term used to say that instead of intimacy in a relationship, you can get the sex for free( via slut, whore, prostitute, etc.) Also in the statement, " Why buy the cow, when you can get the milk for free?" From RvB   Caboose: My dad always said " Why buy the cow, when you can get the milk for free?"  Church: Hey Rookie. Did you just call my girfriend a cow?  Tucker: No dude, I think he called her a slut.

üò≤ Every fucking time
<|endoftext|>
I'm not joking
<|endoftext|>
niall is no man
<|endoftext|>
i think that's more than coincedence niall. you may be turning women gay. please stop
<|endoftext|>
She always talks about some girl too
<|endoftext|>
Wait
<|endoftext|>
...
<|endoftext|>
message her
<|endoftext|>
Is she gay and I'm not paying attention
<|endoftext|>
just "yo you a fag?"
<|endoftext|>
in a weird accent
<|endoftext|>
Nah I'm kinda depressed, and she picked it up and if i message her then she won't be worried for me anymore
<|endoftext|>
It's a large scheme
<|endoftext|>
there were many reasons not to ask her, and i think you found the worst one
<|endoftext|>
One day I'll ask my friends to die for me
<|endoftext|>
And they will
<|endoftext|>
Only tim will die for you, the rest we'll kill if you pay enough. Side positive for louie, tinder just became 1.2% more likely
<|endoftext|>
so you still have no idea why i want you to do that. how so? bc you're trying to nail lesbos?
<|endoftext|>
Don't you think my scheme would be at a grander scale than this tomfoolery
<|endoftext|>
huh?
<|endoftext|>
Ahahahahahahahahah
<|endoftext|>
I'm a villain
<|endoftext|>
i think i have to mute ali soon, it's getting weird

<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Dont

for tims sake
<|endoftext|>
why would tim give a shit? he's a real man, unlike you
<|endoftext|>
shes just a normal mormon girl, living in a lonely world
<|endoftext|>
she takes the midnight train going anywhere
<|endoftext|>
@Tim Get involved in the chat tim, defend your honour you little bitch
<|endoftext|>
Away from Tim's Dm's

<|endoftext|>
she doesnt know  her name
<|endoftext|>
nobody does
<|endoftext|>
especially tim
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

@Louie1505 you said the same thing ages ago, look up a map

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
yup, not necessary
<|endoftext|>
josch is up for civ
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I think Becky just came out
<|endoftext|>
yay! don't worry niall, we'll find another lesbo for you to try it with soon
<|endoftext|>
I told her about the knowledge i found from this and after a bit she said this
<|endoftext|>
This is interesting
<|endoftext|>
@Laxxy said what
<|endoftext|>
She told me that i wasn't wrong and started to send pics of her crush because i didn't believe her at first
<|endoftext|>
I have a fucking gift
<|endoftext|>
I deduced that she was homosexual moments after seeing her face
<|endoftext|>
you're fake news rodney
<|endoftext|>
oh, cool. well i hope she's ashameed of herself.  she getting electroshock therapy?  also Rodney Mututugu: Fag hunter, premiering tonight on dave
<|endoftext|>
Fag hunter ?
<|endoftext|>
Those are awful sentences but the second onw is funny
<|endoftext|>
plz delete them
<|endoftext|>
as in ghost hunter rodney, bc you can sense them
<|endoftext|>
and no
<|endoftext|>
i stand by my jokes
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
I do not sense. I use interlect
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Interlect
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Why expose me
<|endoftext|>
It's mad in the GC now
<|endoftext|>
i hate that i know what all these acronyms stand for
<|endoftext|>
N-I-A-C
<|endoftext|>
niall is a cuck
<|endoftext|>
Well, this has been enlightening. I speak for the whole of this chat and send her our best wishes. Lets never bring this up again.
<|endoftext|>
Omg someone just said mormans should die
<|endoftext|>
they should
<|endoftext|>
Bit of jump from someone coming out to mormon hate
<|endoftext|>
Also Becky said she has gay pride clothes stored in her wardrobe
<|endoftext|>
More things coming out of the closet
<|endoftext|>
Milk means well done btw
<|endoftext|>
it's the highest honour in this here server
<|endoftext|>
e.g: "I appreciated that joke" *clicks on milk
<|endoftext|>
Mirku
<|endoftext|>
i guess the only higher honour is if niall gives you his milk in person
<|endoftext|>
So far, no one has earned that honour. *or wanted it*
<|endoftext|>
true. most people he offers it to have become lesbians
<|endoftext|>
Ahahahahaha
<|endoftext|>
He can fuck right off
<|endoftext|>

It's was a joke from me and her
<|endoftext|>
niall still makes women gay
<|endoftext|>
Hope Niall doesn't hate me
<|endoftext|>
It was Becky's idea to tell you guys about her not being gay so
<|endoftext|>
...
<|endoftext|>
i think it's important to realise that nobody except niall cares, we're just very entertained by the situation

Decent film, cool fights, original-ish story with great but sad ending.
<|endoftext|>
no after-credits scene
<|endoftext|>
they've said it isn't canon, but yeah probably the best wolverine film
<|endoftext|>
Finished watching?
<|endoftext|>
not exactly a high bar but still
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
They combined like three different comic stories and twisted them to make them realistic which i appreciated
<|endoftext|>
Wasn't brilliant for some reason but it was good. Ending scenes was worth it tho
<|endoftext|>
think it's always needed the 18 rating, it's a character that calls for it. probably why the others are so awful
<|endoftext|>
yeah, brutal and realistic fights are better than flashy ones in this area
<|endoftext|>
yup, like giant samurai

<|endoftext|>
ok so i got benned from the rest of the competitive season for leaving a game
<|endoftext|>
i don't even remember any other times i've left
<|endoftext|>
That was dumb
<|endoftext|>
Maybe you shouldn't have left
<|endoftext|>
ok that's fair, but a whole season ban?
<|endoftext|>
At least Not a lifetime ban
<|endoftext|>
think they only give those to filthy cheaters like you
<|endoftext|>
That probably explains why people don't quit all the time anymore
<|endoftext|>
yeah, they're all banned
<|endoftext|>
overwatch cucked them
<|endoftext|>
want to play somthing?

just build it custom with arts from amazon

parts
<|endoftext|>
i need to do my research first
<|endoftext|>
yeah, it's not hard. get a motherboard and see if it's ddr3 or ddr4 then buy ram that is compatible, then cvheck what socket it uses and buy the best cpu for that socket. get a 10-series nvidia card and use a psu calculator to see how much wattage you need then buy one that will power it all
<|endoftext|>
then just grab a few tb hard driuve and a smaller ssd
<|endoftext|>
probably gonna need an aftermarket cooler too
<|endoftext|>
(i need it to be under 600 bcuz im poor)

<|endoftext|>
i think they got them back
<|endoftext|>
i saw them in a cartoon on disney before
<|endoftext|>
cool. In a bunch of comics dagger is kinda a bitch and cloak doesn't really speak much. I wonder how theyre gonna make the characters more loveable
<|endoftext|>
(no costumes in trailer üòñ )
<|endoftext|>
I like it
<|endoftext|>
They're not mutants
<|endoftext|>
They got their powers from druggos

In the comics, which are cannon, they are mutants

Otherwise he's an advanced nightcrawler

The pages are concentrated with all the physics questions you will want to die for
<|endoftext|>

@Laxxy do you have a decent pc?
<|endoftext|>
hi hi @Tired
<|endoftext|>
(this is louie
<|endoftext|>
hello
<|endoftext|>
)
<|endoftext|>
want to play a bad battle royale game?
<|endoftext|>
i cant right now but what game is it?
<|endoftext|>
last man standing, maybe another time then. welcome to the server anyway, if you click on names on the right you might be able to figure out who people are
<|endoftext|>
i mean doesnt look as bad as like, any ubisoft game. but yeah thanks
<|endoftext|>
Don't trust the profile pictures
<|endoftext|>
(Im Niall, not a fish girl. Louie is not as cool as his picture)
<|endoftext|>
im pretty sure youre a fish girl
<|endoftext|>
only on halloween and whenever i get an excuse
<|endoftext|>
niall's name has a fun story behind it, i'll tell you at some point
<|endoftext|>
alrighty
<|endoftext|>
(was busy) so every girl niall has tried to fuck this year has come out as gay shortly after, which i imagine much be frustrating for him but so entertaining for us
<|endoftext|>
nah hes not frustrated, hes proud of his natural talent of coverting girls to gay
<|endoftext|>
how many times has that happened?
<|endoftext|>
2 or maybe 3 arguably
<|endoftext|>
i mean, its what he gets for stalking people
<|endoftext|>
it's weird how you knew without being told...be very careful with this, but if you click the drawing pin at the top the 2nd girl is the 2nd most recent pin
<|endoftext|>
maybe don't scroll through
<|endoftext|>
or do
<|endoftext|>
without being told what? ah okay.
<|endoftext|>
fuckin so much hentai
<|endoftext|>
that he was a stalker. we have a bot
<|endoftext|>
+rule34 ryan
<|endoftext|>
louie1505 http://img.rule34.xxx/images/1613/841a7963f17805d69709e5b6f3e8c09feb74de10.png
<|endoftext|>
nah he was doing that to a girl when i was still at loreto remember, that one girl he followed home to find out where she lived. and this bot is the greatest thing of all time
<|endoftext|>
@Misery which girl was this?
<|endoftext|>
yeah it's pretty fun
<|endoftext|>
i think it was the one that took the 86 our way so he came that way too
<|endoftext|>
oh yeah fuck, i'd forgotten about that
<|endoftext|>
bet he hates this conversation
<|endoftext|>
what was her name?
<|endoftext|>
yeah hes been a creep for a while, and i think michael mentioned him stalking a new girl again when i met with him, nialls a bad person
<|endoftext|>
might have been talking about that ginger girl
<|endoftext|>
its possible
<|endoftext|>
how hasnt he been found breaking into peoples houses to sniff their underwear though?
<|endoftext|>
he's very quiet when he wants to be, like a cat man
<|endoftext|>
yeah but like, id think someone wouldve been concerned about the cum stains by now
<|endoftext|>
you mean some people don't find mysterious cum stains in their clothes?
<|endoftext|>
no they dont. Niall reached new lows...
<|endoftext|>
motherfucker, need to change my locks again
<|endoftext|>
honestly, just beat him to death in front of people, youll get the satisfaction of his death and then the cheers of the bystanders
<|endoftext|>
not a bad plan. @Tyranulous you want to help me kill this jew cuck?
<|endoftext|>
guess i'll go fuck myself. you have a laptop charger then ryan or are you on something else?
<|endoftext|>
yeah im on my laptop now
<|endoftext|>
oh nice. be good to have a 4th that can actually run stuff, niall just has a normal laptop
<|endoftext|>
yeah but unfortunately im poor so i cant buy things to play them
<|endoftext|>
torrent or f2ps, we're all poor
<|endoftext|>
well yeah thats usually what i do
<|endoftext|>
right anyway im gonna try get an early night, goodnight
<|endoftext|>
night
<|endoftext|>
just remembered this happened, why was did michael ask me if niall has a big dick? he told me that niall told him id back him up on it being big?
<|endoftext|>
A recuring joke, altho size is new
<|endoftext|>
right right okay, well i made sure to tell him how small it was, just for you
<|endoftext|>
Oh haha. Niall insists that you two fucked at my house when you stayed on the sofa
<|endoftext|>
i mean we mightve but if we did he was very gentle and too small to feel
<|endoftext|>
Sounds like a good time
<|endoftext|>
im sure he had fun
<|endoftext|>
does @Tyranulous want to play when i'm done voting?
<|endoftext|>
voting?
<|endoftext|>
you didn't get a ballot?
<|endoftext|>
thats not today is it?
<|endoftext|>
postal vote
<|endoftext|>
ah
<|endoftext|>
why postal vote?
<|endoftext|>
i'm lazy
<|endoftext|>
ffs
<|endoftext|>
it makes no difference, just means i don't have to go anywhere. also it's a thursday which is a full day so i would either be gojg before or after college
<|endoftext|>
how terrible
<|endoftext|>
more terrible than filling in the date and 2 Xs on a sheet that came to me, then walking to the post box at some point
<|endoftext|>
<--
<|endoftext|>
@Tired want to play something with us?
<|endoftext|>

@Tyranulous let me know when you're at mcdonalds or something, i'll meet you at the co-op and we can get a bottle of somethin g
<|endoftext|>
McDonald's?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Ah, will do
<|endoftext|>
Have you won lms yet?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
haha
<|endoftext|>
just got 10th. you wanna have a game?
<|endoftext|>
really want to beat it once before i stop playing
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
oh btw, unfortunately it turns out that i'm too lazy to carry my pc downstairs so you get to have some more adventures in ds1 instead
<|endoftext|>
ffs it would be so much more playable on a pc
<|endoftext|>
and even better with no ds1
<|endoftext|>
ithink i have a save that's far later in that game if that's any consolation, no more early game bullshit
<|endoftext|>
i'll check now, 1 min
<|endoftext|>
ah shit, nope, i have no save data
<|endoftext|>
"no more early game bs" beacuase that was my problem with the game...
<|endoftext|>
your problem with the game is tat you're a noob and you need to get good
<|endoftext|>
if it really bothers you i can bring my pc down
<|endoftext|>
i'll be very upset though
<|endoftext|>
i may hurt myself
<|endoftext|>
do you happen to have some sort of wireless keyboard/aio keyboard and trackpad?
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
err no
<|endoftext|>
ok, i might just use my laptop and anydesk
<|endoftext|>
couldn't you do steam remote access or whatever tf it's called
<|endoftext|>
i've tried, it doesn't work well for some reason. i get like 10fps
<|endoftext|>
thats your amazing iternet
<|endoftext|>
*internet
<|endoftext|>
oh, can you bring an xbox one controller? i only have wireless, don't really want to untangle my adapter
<|endoftext|>
sure, one or 2
<|endoftext|>
may as well bring 2, can play something else
<|endoftext|>
i can even bring a wired 360
<|endoftext|>
or 3
<|endoftext|>
yeah, all or either orn
<|endoftext|>
or whatever
<|endoftext|>
though i'm not sure how many micro b cables i have for the xb1 ones
<|endoftext|>
actually, just found something of my brother's that might work
<|endoftext|>
yeah?
<|endoftext|>
What IT past paper we supposed to do
<|endoftext|>
Just bring the controllers then? We'll grab something to drink from the co-op. Niall still hasn't come on
<|endoftext|>
what paper
<|endoftext|>
I swear we had to do one
<|endoftext|>
Why you sending mms's
<|endoftext|>
no discord on phone, not on fb anymore. can get viber if it upsets you that much
<|endoftext|>
still no niall, reckon he'll actually be here for 5?
<|endoftext|>
No idea, depends if he remembers
<|endoftext|>
Have you tried calling him
<|endoftext|>
not yet, i'll call shortly. not sure he knows it's 5, he hasn't been on at all today
<|endoftext|>
you setting off? calling him now
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
http://lmgtfy.com/?s=k&q=discord+skins
<|endoftext|>
there is if you have turbo or whatever. only a couple of months and you'll have space to build a pc, then you can just throw it on a second monitor
<|endoftext|>
like joosch said, if you're going to search for it make sure you use safari and ask.com
<|endoftext|>
yep
<|endoftext|>
you don't use the ask safari combo?
<|endoftext|>
nothing but
<|endoftext|>
dont sas me *boy*

<|endoftext|>
Bodney
<|endoftext|>
Seriousness
<|endoftext|>
hawt
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous play that game now? need to do anything except computing work, might be fun
<|endoftext|>
urgh sure
<|endoftext|>
called 'we were here', not huge
<|endoftext|>
7mins
<|endoftext|>
ok, @ me
<|endoftext|>
Cooler than cool
<|endoftext|>
@me
<|endoftext|>
@joinvoice
<|endoftext|>
the japanese make some great games
<|endoftext|>
fixed
<|endoftext|>
Super hawt
<|endoftext|>
its one of the most emotionally effecting interactions i have ever had in a game tbh
<|endoftext|>
and they told me that keeping underage girls as pets was wrong
<|endoftext|>
thats why you kill them immediately, or just unlock the rub ability and have her call the guards over for sexual assult, its an odd game
<|endoftext|>
sounds it
<|endoftext|>
like its mostly a traditional roguelike crossed with life sim and sandbox, but like my dog was drinking from  a fountain and a trap killed it and someone ran off with the body, thats not quite normal i dont think
<|endoftext|>
gotta love the japanese
<|endoftext|>
yeah, they have beautiful minds dont they?
<|endoftext|>
indeed they do. @Tim PLAY DOUBLES?
<|endoftext|>
oops
<|endoftext|>
well then tim... @Rodney @Ebon tattersall is walking up and down my street looking confused
<|endoftext|>
why tf would tattersall be in your street?
<|endoftext|>
i have no idea. she was halding a clipboard and walking round like she didn't know where she was
<|endoftext|>
i mean she probably lives in the ville or somthing
<|endoftext|>
maybe she's doing some political thing
<|endoftext|>
yeah, maybe
<|endoftext|>
Wanna play now ?
<|endoftext|>
sure
<|endoftext|>
<-
<|endoftext|>
Give me a minute
<|endoftext|>
lol to ryry and lol to tattersall

Found this old thing, it's has a Pentium 4
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Just realised it's has a floppy disk  drive
<|endoftext|>
A://mazing

@Tyranulous ??
<|endoftext|>
weird right?
<|endoftext|>
how so?
<|endoftext|>
they dont want me to send it back
<|endoftext|>
Ahaha sell it
<|endoftext|>
oh, yeah that's not that uncommon. i have 2 copies of fallout 3 after refunding one
<|endoftext|>
i mean it is broken
<|endoftext|>
never happend to me before
<|endoftext|>
whyd you buy 2 coppies of fallout
<|endoftext|>
one was all scratched so i refunded it and bought another but they didn't want the old one back
<|endoftext|>
happened with a couple of things
<|endoftext|>
they couldn't exatly sell a super scratched disc though
<|endoftext|>
true, but panasonic can't sell broken headphones, the point is that we could just be lying and get the thing for free
<|endoftext|>
tbh it would be an almost totally risk free way of getting stuff
<|endoftext|>
if they ask for it back you loose no money and if they don't: profit
<|endoftext|>
sounds like a bamboozle, i'm in
<|endoftext|>
also @Misery where the fuck were ou today?
<|endoftext|>
Head cold and fever, had it since sunday night. most likely be in tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

Back to bring some pride
<|endoftext|>
content online in languages as of march 2017
<|endoftext|>
kinda thought japanese wouldve been above german
<|endoftext|>
close enough. (i think the 0 interest banks are in german)
<|endoftext|>
but like, think of all the japanese doujinshi hentai comics put online every single day
<|endoftext|>
i think they be images tho - then they get put on a bunch of sites that are multinational so each language gets hiy equally.
<|endoftext|>
yeah no thats true makes sense
<|endoftext|>
also why and when did it become the lyon pride?

<|endoftext|>

actually let me upgrade that

almost certainly
<|endoftext|>
let me know when you've eaten then. i've devised a segment for halfway through

depends on how long we record
<|endoftext|>
it's a surprise though
<|endoftext|>
an hour ish
<|endoftext|>
the problem with haveing live gameplay
<|endoftext|>
is that you can't really edit

i can edit
<|endoftext|>
in the same way that a normal recording would be edited
<|endoftext|>
oh i see what you mean. i wasn't planning to cut anything out
<|endoftext|>
not really editing then is it
<|endoftext|>
though if i sync it up it shouldn't matter if we lose 30 seconds of footage

if you sync it up?

<|endoftext|>
oi
<|endoftext|>
2 mins
<|endoftext|>
I'm about to have a few rounds of HoTS if anyone wants to join (@me if so)
<|endoftext|>
why the rar?
<|endoftext|>
also your audio still managed to pick up on my mic for the raw input. i'll try and edit around it
<|endoftext|>
you spoke so little
<|endoftext|>
i know
<|endoftext|>
something something didn't have any thing to say,
<|endoftext|>
was also concentrating on game somewhat
<|endoftext|>
(and still achieved absoloutly nothing
<|endoftext|>
)
<|endoftext|>
btw it might be worth me syncing audio up and using audio from discord from you (embeded in the video recording) and exporting that as a single file for you to fuck with
<|endoftext|>
we would then get game audio
<|endoftext|>
<<
<|endoftext|>
what about "almost informed" or "nearly informed" as a title?
<|endoftext|>
apparently there's an anniversary ow event starting tuesday
<|endoftext|>
get hype
<|endoftext|>
get limited skins
<|endoftext|>
How long does it last?
<|endoftext|>
they're usually a couple of weeks
<|endoftext|>
also supposedly going to be a goty edition coming out
<|endoftext|>
also update windows, there's a fix for that ransomware exploit
<|endoftext|>
just got kicked for inactivity on a load screen
<|endoftext|>
Excellent code!
<|endoftext|>
Also didn't it say that the march update was what patched it
<|endoftext|>
i ahev the sn (sl?) number in my update queue
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
the update
<|endoftext|>
came gold for kills and got potg as widow. think i'm pro now
<|endoftext|>
Sure
<|endoftext|>
Or just lucky
<|endoftext|>
how dare you. i'm top 10 widow players
<|endoftext|>
https://www.dropbox.com/s/shrgykjp4vkpd1j/podcast1joshRender.wmv?dl=0
<|endoftext|>
cool, thanks. i have plans today but i'm free tomorrow so i'll edit then
<|endoftext|>
come play?
<|endoftext|>
having one or 2 more, need to do work
<|endoftext|>
<
<|endoftext|>
i like how my local audio was a larger file than all of that audio and the video combined
<|endoftext|>
i did render it
<|endoftext|>
it was originally 20 gb
<|endoftext|>
fun. i'm not sure i'm getting this done today but i can do a little bit. you have any requests? i'm going to bleep niall's name, something like an intro or effect or whatever
<|endoftext|>
may have lost my audio depending on what audacity feels like doing after this export. hope i sound ok in the video audio
<|endoftext|>
thats fun
<|endoftext|>
ur a fag
<|endoftext|>
oh my god, he's found my secret
<|endoftext|>
what will i do now!?
<|endoftext|>
ow?
<|endoftext|>
Sorry i didn't mean it. Busy man, tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous i can play now if you're free
<|endoftext|>
now?
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous you alive?
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505 yes
<|endoftext|>
also so true
<|endoftext|>
what happened?
<|endoftext|>
when?
<|endoftext|>
i had to go eat
<|endoftext|>
oh, i  thought you crahsed or something
<|endoftext|>
have that match now?
<|endoftext|>
<
<|endoftext|>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk6JMSrqiQo
<|endoftext|>
replace that stock cooler bro
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous you end up not going in then?
<|endoftext|>
ive got frees monday morning
<|endoftext|>
oh ok. are you going in later?
<|endoftext|>
probably
<|endoftext|>
but think of all the fun we could have
<|endoftext|>
you could tell me how good i look in shirts
<|endoftext|>
doesn't that sound thrilling
<|endoftext|>
ummm...no?
<|endoftext|>
i'll force feed lamb to giles if you talk to me like that again
<|endoftext|>
thats nice
<|endoftext|>
kind of old for lamb bur
<|endoftext|>
but
<|endoftext|>
mutton it is then
<|endoftext|>
when you send a half finished email full of typos with no files attached to your future employer and say you've attatched the documents they wanted üò¶
<|endoftext|>
wtf how do you even mannage that
<|endoftext|>
apparently shift+enter is send not new lins
<|endoftext|>
good job! üëè üëè üëè üëè
<|endoftext|>
it's new line in any messaging client bc enter is send, i'm just used yo it
<|endoftext|>
um yeah it's just enter
<|endoftext|>
somehow i doubt they'll fire you though
<|endoftext|>
fair
<|endoftext|>
apparently upwards of 100 new items in this event
<|endoftext|>
also hots event starts today
<|endoftext|>
do you not have anything do other than annoying me?
<|endoftext|>
i'm playing overwatch. how come you're annoyed bb?
<|endoftext|>
i hope your revision is going ok
<|endoftext|>
wtf why does tts work on dnd
<|endoftext|>
also as a future soloution to email woes, you could just not enter the address until you are sure you want to send it
<|endoftext|>
also send on google is ctrl enter
<|endoftext|>
that is a good point, except it was a reply
<|endoftext|>
i may be able to get naill an apprenticeship through my new rep at nowskills. is he deserving of my help after his failed coup?
<|endoftext|>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jKylhJtPmI
<|endoftext|>
well fuck
<|endoftext|>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciNHn38EyRc
<|endoftext|>
Why are you sending me these videos?
<|endoftext|>
they're interesting and i'm going into web programming
<|endoftext|>
why are you a moody cunt today?
<|endoftext|>
You are? Remind me to get you to make me a website if I ever need one :rodtaylorsmallhq3x: :rodtaylorsmallhq3x:
<|endoftext|>
all of cognisoft's software is web based. i'm not a web designer i'm going into software development with sql and php web based backend develeopment that links to databases and the like
<|endoftext|>
i'm not learning how to make it pretty i'm learning how to prevent stuff like sql injections
<|endoftext|>
Exactly you can do some really cool back end stuff on my website which I don't have
<|endoftext|>
sure, you just give me a call
<|endoftext|>
give me a terrible, low budget site that i might be able to hack into
<|endoftext|>
actually i might be able to get into college
<|endoftext|>
Haha I doubt it
<|endoftext|>
They lock everything down so much
<|endoftext|>
you're probably right
<|endoftext|>
Would be great (and fun though)
<|endoftext|>
going to try and find a shitty little chicken place or something#
<|endoftext|>
can't find any with a search bar
<|endoftext|>
my brother's high school just gave me full control of the database
<|endoftext|>
Really??!
<|endoftext|>
Like through SQL injection? Or just because...?
<|endoftext|>
sql injection. i didn't actually run the code but i was able to perform the test searches etc that i would need to do if i was going to run real commands
<|endoftext|>
Wow, ameturs. A shame it's illegal :D
<|endoftext|>
is this blackmail?
<|endoftext|>
Maybe you should become a l33t hacker and extort the school
<|endoftext|>
I think that's a stellar idea
<|endoftext|>
i'm sure that's what you think
<|endoftext|>
And then I can find out if there's a reward for you
<|endoftext|>
but that pony tail man is too powerful, his code is too strong for me
<|endoftext|>
Haha loreto isn't susceptable to the attack
<|endoftext|>
You can try a slow Lorris next, I think loreto does use Apache
<|endoftext|>
you tried sql inject on them?
<|endoftext|>
No?
<|endoftext|>
Sorry fmeant to put a ?
<|endoftext|>
oh, no they're not
<|endoftext|>
not on my loreto at  least, maybe the website
<|endoftext|>
Does it even have a database connected
<|endoftext|>
And if so, why
<|endoftext|>
maybe f  html docs for news stories and one of images
<|endoftext|>
i guess
<|endoftext|>
want to play ow or somthing? just got on my computer
<|endoftext|>
shore
<|endoftext|>
niall got his ticket today like a good little boy
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
how did you know?
<|endoftext|>
wtf are you on about
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

http://www.techspot.com/news/69572-denuvo-allegedly-protected-own-anti-piracy-software-pirated.html @Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
hahha why ami not suprised
<|endoftext|>
ikr, i have no problem with drm in general but  i hate denuvo. prey got cracked though
<|endoftext|>
at what point will the anti privacy people give up
<|endoftext|>
seems like the games would make more money if they put more money into making it making it (slightly more) worth the 60¬£ price tag
<|endoftext|>
they'll stop when the dead horse stops spitting out money. publishers won't accept that people will A) pirate a game regardless and B) usually just won't play a game if they can't pirate it, rather than buy it. just means people like denuvo can rake in cash from the industry, and yeah cut into game budget like you said
<|endoftext|>
how's the revisiongoing?
<|endoftext|>
that about sums it up
<|endoftext|>
also tears
<|endoftext|>
have you had any exams yet?

<|endoftext|>
anyone know much about macros?
<|endoftext|>
for what software? like games or adobe or something?
<|endoftext|>
just autohotkey macros
<|endoftext|>
it can be easy to find for specific software but not in general, louie found something that rebind his keyboard but im not sure if it can macro. Google for a while and try tec-blogs or just get extensions to each software you use
<|endoftext|>
right okay
<|endoftext|>
yeah i was using autohotkey, wanted to be able to switch my num row from symbols to numbers, kinds like caps lock for programming. what are you trying to do @Tired
<|endoftext|>
Just want to know if alt codes (like alt-30 making a triangle) can be changed to do things more useful, or just the numpad in general really, mostly useless keys for me
<|endoftext|>
yeah definitely, just look up their keycodes and tell ahk to intercept them. you have to write script but i bet there's sample stuff online which you could modify for hat you actually wanted them to do
<|endoftext|>
Alright thanks, ill go ahead and try that then

<|endoftext|>
airmen?
<|endoftext|>
i think
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
@Misery come play?
<|endoftext|>
i thought you were talking about gunsoficarusonline
<|endoftext|>
it's an itchio game
<|endoftext|>
is this the game with the ziphook?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
im sure giles will play, just rescue him from that house
<|endoftext|>
he was killed
<|endoftext|>
:giles:  no!?
<|endoftext|>
rip my sweet angel
<|endoftext|>
what day does silicon valley air on?
<|endoftext|>
same as got
<|endoftext|>
I actually need to go do stuff, sorry
<|endoftext|>
lie
<|endoftext|>
son/mon depending
<|endoftext|>
yeah fuck you timmy
<|endoftext|>
gladly
<|endoftext|>
sounds good
<|endoftext|>
you get those loot chests niall
<|endoftext|>
i just past level 25
<|endoftext|>
now im going to eat alot to celebrate, no one is invited
<|endoftext|>
amazing. how much work did you do today? also how did you not hang yourself during it
<|endoftext|>
i went to an interview, checked out a bunch of people complaining about a physics mock and played 3 games of hots. a semi-prod day üåá
<|endoftext|>
what blazer did you end up getting?
<|endoftext|>
I just wore a üëî and üëû
<|endoftext|>
cool
<|endoftext|>
no trousers?
<|endoftext|>
:giles:
<|endoftext|>
still good for friday btw?
<|endoftext|>
yep
<|endoftext|>
he had his dick out
<|endoftext|>
cool
<|endoftext|>
revise-test-interview-vote-viewing  üóì
<|endoftext|>
nope, election is tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
yep, mon-tues-wed-thur-fri üóì
<|endoftext|>
oh ok
<|endoftext|>
im going to go eat until i cry and call rodney to help me throw-up, ‚òÆ
<|endoftext|>
that's...good
<|endoftext|>
How do i turn off temperature safety? or is there another way to stop my cpu purposely reducing its processes during games?
<|endoftext|>
build a pc. don't burn your laptop
<|endoftext|>
hots keeps giving me a message that my cpu is deliberately slowing down during matches
<|endoftext|>
yeah bc you can't run it. either your cpu slows down or starts a fire
<|endoftext|>
other people have been getting my problem, i was correct in thinking the patch fucked it up
<|endoftext|>
possibly but the solution isn't to burn your laptop, just let blizzard sort it
<|endoftext|>
blizzard gave the final solution to the problem. ‚ùÑ
<|endoftext|>
just build a pc once you're moved out and working, then you can just upgrade cooling when something like this happens
<|endoftext|>
anyone wann a play hots? you'll get cool 2yr anniversry stuff
<|endoftext|>
did you watch the livestream of Comey?
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
i'm just gonna assume that was for me btw
<|endoftext|>
ye
<|endoftext|>
theres another steam of trump's lawyer about the speak
<|endoftext|>
stream
<|endoftext|>
when?
<|endoftext|>
i dont know when he starts speaking but the stream is gaining views
<|endoftext|>
link me? is  trump not testifying?
<|endoftext|>
Watch "WATCH LIVE: President Trump's lawyer responds to Comey testimony" on YouTube https://youtu.be/mjDNe9A0QfI
<|endoftext|>
oh it's just a press conference, thought he was testifying. what did you think of comey?
<|endoftext|>
i dont think he did much wrong
<|endoftext|>
anyways nobody can really say no to a president
<|endoftext|>
yeah true. i want him impeached but also then we have pence who is far worse
<|endoftext|>
i guess we will see what happens
<|endoftext|>
i think phillip mututugu should lead us all
<|endoftext|>
unify the world into one rwanda
<|endoftext|>
im from zimbabwe mate
<|endoftext|>
sure
<|endoftext|>
Stop with this covfefe
<|endoftext|>
never
<|endoftext|>
Ooh
<|endoftext|>
just started rod, they're just denying everything
<|endoftext|>
This is crazy
<|endoftext|>
not really any evidence either way i suppose
<|endoftext|>
Best case scenario. Nothing happens
<|endoftext|>
Who voted then?
<|endoftext|>
moi
<|endoftext|>
Tim and rod are too young and josch is too european i guess.
<|endoftext|>
think josch voted, he wants out of the eu bc if his parents are deported he becomes the patriarch and his sister must obey him.  you vote?
<|endoftext|>
yep üî¥ :download1:
<|endoftext|>
:nazi1:
<|endoftext|>
usurper hit me up
<|endoftext|>
careful niall, probably another lesbo
<|endoftext|>
it's jan
<|endoftext|>
oh yeah haha, thought it was one of the bots
<|endoftext|>
no its not
<|endoftext|>
its rondey
<|endoftext|>
incase there was ever any doubt about a north-south divide in this country
<|endoftext|>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENeCYwms-Cc
<|endoftext|>
worth a watch then
<|endoftext|>
not a single lib dem seat yet, 28-20 where it matters
<|endoftext|>
your result comes out 2 hours before mine
<|endoftext|>
stret-urm efficiency is famous this side of the 51st parallel
<|endoftext|>
clearly not as efficient as islwyn, erewash, or dundee east
<|endoftext|>
they cheat by genetifying the pop until it has a small number of constituants
<|endoftext|>
fun. here in chorlton we just burn the real ballots and replace them with labor ones
<|endoftext|>
almost 1/6 of seats announced, 33-53
<|endoftext|>
(for labour)
<|endoftext|>
first day of E3 boys
<|endoftext|>
anyone watching? battlefront II is probably tonight @Tim
<|endoftext|>
i thought it starts tomorrow with microsoft
<|endoftext|>
EA is tonight
<|endoftext|>
Where
<|endoftext|>
los angeles?
<|endoftext|>
ea ü§¢
<|endoftext|>
Link
<|endoftext|>
zelda
<|endoftext|>
being quite demanding rod
<|endoftext|>
ikr
<|endoftext|>
it starts at 8 rod, it'll be live on yt gaming prime time
<|endoftext|>
Wtf am I gonna do with la
<|endoftext|>
you asked where it was
<|endoftext|>
Alrigt
<|endoftext|>
just google for a stream, most major news outlets do them and also it's live on yt, twitch, etc
<|endoftext|>
facebook
<|endoftext|>
possibly even snapchat
<|endoftext|>
the game awards was
<|endoftext|>
HotS
<|endoftext|>
ok, the new battlefront looks playable
<|endoftext|>
they actually decided to use the old good formula
<|endoftext|>
it does. everyone loves episode 1!
<|endoftext|>
actually does look decent, kinda overwatch though
<|endoftext|>
it's how the game worked before just now called a classs system
<|endoftext|>
no i meant the different maps it showed before, with assault/payload/combo
<|endoftext|>
yeah i guess
<|endoftext|>
but they're normal tropes
<|endoftext|>
fair
<|endoftext|>
they've been showing this demo for ages
<|endoftext|>
and i apreciate that
<|endoftext|>
i dont like sports games
<|endoftext|>
but fifa story
<|endoftext|>
and racing games lose interest fast unless people are diehard
<|endoftext|>
guess we should get battlefront, bet timmy would like that
<|endoftext|>
i cant run that and i would wait until hands-on feedback exists until purchase
<|endoftext|>
you also will probably have a pc by the time it comes out
<|endoftext|>
who's adolf?
<|endoftext|>
mickey
<|endoftext|>
oh
<|endoftext|>
he so  fine he blows my mind
<|endoftext|>
...
<|endoftext|>
Hello I wanted to see some reactions
<|endoftext|>
fear
<|endoftext|>
give him some reactions
<|endoftext|>
i really hope reactions show up on mobile
<|endoftext|>
it's only 20/20 but im happy they adding back the bots, it's not the game without the bots
<|endoftext|>
They had bots in the first one though. Not for all modes but like you could do them
<|endoftext|>
well im going back into a game of hots, ill be back in like 20min with more reactions
<|endoftext|>
#playabettergame
<|endoftext|>
#likeoverwatch
<|endoftext|>
or not, it looks finished
<|endoftext|>
Was anything on the stream before battlefront?
<|endoftext|>
ALEX TURNER
<|endoftext|>
sport games, new ip  lkike kane and lynch
<|endoftext|>
what?
<|endoftext|>
you missed the most talked about man in a british accent
<|endoftext|>
(did i get the name right of the fake fifa person)
<|endoftext|>
npoe, that's the arctic monkeys frontman
<|endoftext|>
it was alex something
<|endoftext|>
not turner i'd assume
<|endoftext|>
Great, mobile games
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
download it for free, bitch
<|endoftext|>
#staringatawallisbetterthanheroesofthestorm
<|endoftext|>
it's a nice casual moba
<|endoftext|>
dont bring your hate
<|endoftext|>
go get casual STDs from lesbians, way better use of your time
<|endoftext|>
or ill start saying that OW is just TF2 thrown through a blizzard marketing blender and wiped of most its content
<|endoftext|>
but you'd be wrong, and also you've never played it so you don't get an opinion, you're just repeating other people's opinions
<|endoftext|>
which are also wrong
<|endoftext|>
it's my opinion
<|endoftext|>
based on nothing
<|endoftext|>
i said during beta it's a tf2 redo and it cant be denide. nothing wrong with it but it doesnt deserve so much credit.
<|endoftext|>
dinide haha.  it's very different to tf2, there are similarities but you can find similarities between a huge amount of games within a genre. also a game deserves credit primarily based on how fun and entertaining it is, and how well it plays, and it manages that very very well
<|endoftext|>
they're really proud of this racing game
<|endoftext|>
bf2 looking fine
<|endoftext|>
this is what it should have
<|endoftext|>
wtf?!!!
<|endoftext|>
dont delete that
<|endoftext|>
it offended no one]
<|endoftext|>
im offended
<|endoftext|>
same. how long is this conference?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney can you bring me more drink please bby? i ran out of shots
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
the philipenes have a nasty dectator
<|endoftext|>
dictator*
<|endoftext|>
he was fairly elected and has done nothing wrong, he is a good, christian man
<|endoftext|>
beeb beeb beeb motherfucker
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
tou think tim has just left himself logged into a computer somewhere and forgot? he never responds but is always online
<|endoftext|>
He is 'cuffed to a radiator just out of reach of his keyboard, but close enough to the bookshelf of mormon texts
<|endoftext|>
sounds good. @Rodney your captain needs a crew while a better game downloads
<|endoftext|>
right @Tim ?
<|endoftext|>
have you heard to the tv show izombie?
<|endoftext|>
coincidence
<|endoftext|>
haha
<|endoftext|>
wait im izombie?
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
\o/
<|endoftext|>

WTF! ^
<|endoftext|>
niall come play with us
<|endoftext|>
@Misery
<|endoftext|>
it's fun
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
russain knows how to edit
<|endoftext|>
i dont get it
<|endoftext|>
niall thinks that russians should die in plane crahses
<|endoftext|>
whats the point to the gif
<|endoftext|>
is it real?
<|endoftext|>
what's the point of you
<|endoftext|>
yes rodney, we witnessed death
<|endoftext|>
defo not fake
<|endoftext|>
i dont know if you are being sarcastic or not
<|endoftext|>
it looks fake tho
<|endoftext|>
the software on the right is an overlay software for effects
<|endoftext|>
his cam doesn't change, he just switches feeds
<|endoftext|>
nah, he ded
<|endoftext|>
his timing was fucking on point though, watch the plane, he switches it so perfectly
<|endoftext|>
sorry
<|endoftext|>
**Empathy** just left **No Acting Allowed**. Bye bye **Empathy**...
<|endoftext|>
I'm back
<|endoftext|>
leave again
<|endoftext|>
the xbx boys!
<|endoftext|>
that's actually cool, it needs a computer cooler
<|endoftext|>
shouldn't be loud and whiny as fuck
<|endoftext|>
finally, a racing game that women can play
<|endoftext|>
Solid performance
<|endoftext|>
or get a gtx 10-series. i also appear to have accidently tuned into a motorshow, why are they announcing a real porche
<|endoftext|>
Interesting game
<|endoftext|>
metor?
<|endoftext|>
metro
<|endoftext|>
it looks like fallout on a different engine
<|endoftext|>
Looks like metro but I doubt they'd open with that series, its relativley minor
<|endoftext|>
true
<|endoftext|>
New IP? Crossbow suggests Microsoft wants it's own horizon: Zero Dawn
<|endoftext|>
Well not that minor
<|endoftext|>
told you haha
<|endoftext|>
they can still use a minor franchise to copy horizon. just means they get that franchise's fans too. assassins creed?
<|endoftext|>
asscreed
<|endoftext|>
Doesn't look great
<|endoftext|>
i'd join that
<|endoftext|>
i think it looks good rod
<|endoftext|>
what the fuck is the giant snake? Like they're normally pretty historical
<|endoftext|>
was it not a crocodile?
<|endoftext|>
i hope they remove modern day stuff and add a more fantasy twist
<|endoftext|>
like 3 haha
<|endoftext|>
which everyone hated
<|endoftext|>
i played 3, it was pretty normal
<|endoftext|>
That would make sense probably is a snake. The modern day was a huge part of 3 wasn't it?
<|endoftext|>
maybe i'm thinking of a different one, they all sort of merge together. game looks pretty
<|endoftext|>
be the eagle!
<|endoftext|>
and it's zelda
<|endoftext|>
i remember in 3 you die in a cave, it finished the pre-human era storyline, the triple helix dna stuff to control the apple
<|endoftext|>
The eagle seems kind of weird. Like it looks cool in a demo but might get boring fast in gameplay seeing all enemy locations.
<|endoftext|>
Magic arrow
<|endoftext|>
like batman
<|endoftext|>
the remote batarang
<|endoftext|>
i agree, the far cry camera was too much so fuck an eagle. also legendary gear and a lot of question marks on that hud
<|endoftext|>
rip twitch. im using mixer
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
The bing of streaming
<|endoftext|>
the fighting looked too fast movement but better diverse fighting
<|endoftext|>
i think you're like 20 secs ahead of me niall
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

state of decay II?
<|endoftext|>
I hope so
<|endoftext|>
love the first one
<|endoftext|>
stop spoiling it for me haha
<|endoftext|>
you two are ahead
<|endoftext|>
What stream are you on?
<|endoftext|>
yt
<|endoftext|>
we need less zombie games
<|endoftext|>
*fewer
<|endoftext|>
True but state of decay is good. Maybe try xbox stream on youtube
<|endoftext|>
its a settlement game
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
i guessed sod2 from the filter immediatly
<|endoftext|>
just a flesh wound
<|endoftext|>
Looks like cars are still the  best weapons in the game
<|endoftext|>
always
<|endoftext|>
oh fuck that bitcxh got tore up
<|endoftext|>
wooooh
<|endoftext|>
I love how the hunger games was an allegory for capitalism and how bad reality tv was, but game devs interpretted it as: Wow those games are cool
<|endoftext|>
yeah. i hate everything about that game
<|endoftext|>
new ip?
<|endoftext|>
I think so
<|endoftext|>
ok cross play is actually cool
<|endoftext|>
Yeah I hope it comes to other games, although Microsoft owning minecraft and it being huge helps it
<|endoftext|>
shaders? that it
<|endoftext|>
true. niall, this lesbian doing anything for you?
<|endoftext|>
maybe if you yell at the screen hard enough she'll ignore you
<|endoftext|>
i dont think she is, she's too happy
<|endoftext|>
Minecraft is one of  the games that least needs 4k
<|endoftext|>
yep
<|endoftext|>
will it even look different?
<|endoftext|>
it's just a shader mod
<|endoftext|>
it just means you need more anti-aliasing
<|endoftext|>
this the 3v3 thing?
<|endoftext|>
before people shit on this on the fighting game it's made by the blaze blue people. im not gonna play it but it should be mechancially great
<|endoftext|>
wasn't planning to shit on it, fighing games are either cancer or gold, this looks good
<|endoftext|>
this is blackdesert i think
<|endoftext|>
skyrim
<|endoftext|>
looks good either way
<|endoftext|>
i was right?!
<|endoftext|>
it's different from BDO for some reason
<|endoftext|>
mmorpg, and i'm out
<|endoftext|>
wonder if we happy few will be up tonight
<|endoftext|>
stealth sci-fi platformer
<|endoftext|>
looks pretty
<|endoftext|>
raw fury is what i call my penis
<|endoftext|>
rodney, is that true?
<|endoftext|>
also that game was gorgeous
<|endoftext|>
have we all dropped acid
<|endoftext|>
i know i have
<|endoftext|>
coming when it's damn ready
<|endoftext|>
haha
<|endoftext|>
bayonetta meets prototype
<|endoftext|>
meets ff
<|endoftext|>
BOat mmo!
<|endoftext|>
it's back
<|endoftext|>
you're really far ahead
<|endoftext|>
are you at the show?
<|endoftext|>
Yeah your ahead of me too.
<|endoftext|>
he has huge lungs
<|endoftext|>
and big balls full of shark testostorone
<|endoftext|>
i like consoles having more power bc it means all games are going to be beautiful, we deserve those polygons
<|endoftext|>
I like consoles having shark testosterone
<|endoftext|>
and big balls
<|endoftext|>
of course
<|endoftext|>
we probably should play this though
<|endoftext|>
seems fun
<|endoftext|>
wonder if you can rape in it
<|endoftext|>
twitch:*no man sea*
<|endoftext|>
we can be a cannonball
<|endoftext|>
This demo looks super choreographed. Could mean It's not finished?
<|endoftext|>
oh of course, i'm sure most of these are
<|endoftext|>
it should be fine, it's rare. tacoma is years of teasers
<|endoftext|>
Obviously it's unfinished but like it looks almost colonial marines esque
<|endoftext|>
fyi, this fox game was meant to be vr
<|endoftext|>
still could be
<|endoftext|>
That was some fury bait
<|endoftext|>
wow! it's like mario 64 and banjo kazooie and sonic i don't care
<|endoftext|>
it looked cheap
<|endoftext|>
cuphead has looked very good
<|endoftext|>
Ooo Crackdown?
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
reskin of crackdown 2
<|endoftext|>
it's a sequel...
<|endoftext|>
Indie montage
<|endoftext|>
not all indie
<|endoftext|>
montage was great
<|endoftext|>
crackdown didnt look much different then 2
<|endoftext|>
2 was a zombie game wasn't it?
<|endoftext|>
at night
<|endoftext|>
i think this could have it too
<|endoftext|>
True
<|endoftext|>
looks like better necropolis
<|endoftext|>
similar art
<|endoftext|>
also souls-esque
<|endoftext|>
*Ashen* one
<|endoftext|>
yeah i got it
<|endoftext|>
Life is strange I think?
<|endoftext|>
yeah, prequel
<|endoftext|>
you two play it?
<|endoftext|>
No. Heard it was ok though
<|endoftext|>
i never did
<|endoftext|>
might play with loren
<|endoftext|>
oh and shadow of war
<|endoftext|>
this game looks great, but their marketing has been horrible. they've done 10 hour long livestreams with 20-30 mins gameplay each, it's just getting spoiled
<|endoftext|>
Particularly for a sequel. They don't need to convince people on the core ideas anymore
<|endoftext|>
ikr. i also whish they hadn't called it dominating
<|endoftext|>
Tolkein would be turning in his grave at Pushkrimp the machine
<|endoftext|>
shame him!
<|endoftext|>
he knows orcs are idiots
<|endoftext|>
uruks/trolls
<|endoftext|>
(ogres?)
<|endoftext|>
I Didn't finish the first one but I wish they were replacing Talion in the sequel. He's just a stock character
<|endoftext|>
that's fair
<|endoftext|>
celebrimbor could have bound to someone else
<|endoftext|>
let talion die at the end of 1
<|endoftext|>
ori2? owl cuck
<|endoftext|>
yup ori2
<|endoftext|>
yeah think so
<|endoftext|>
gonna end with halo or?
<|endoftext|>
no halo this year
<|endoftext|>
They still need to talk about Anthem the new Bioware game
<|endoftext|>
still have half an hour
<|endoftext|>
destiny compotition?
<|endoftext|>
this is literally destiny's story
<|endoftext|>
"story"
<|endoftext|>
Looks like its trying to be. Probably won't be great. The Further Bioware get from regular RPGs the worse they are
<|endoftext|>
iron man though
<|endoftext|>
she's pharah too
<|endoftext|>
This looks bad. Like a Destiny Knock off.
<|endoftext|>
it looks cool but not fun, it looks designed to look good and will probably be a whole load of empty
<|endoftext|>
yeah no that was a big snake
<|endoftext|>
@Misery if you're still up for bethesda put the cool stuff in chat, i'm going to go to sleep way before it starts

is it multiplayer

yeah mmo it seems

you watching josch?
<|endoftext|>
soggy nutmegs
<|endoftext|>
so basically that pirate ship fighting game but made by ubi so therefore shit
<|endoftext|>
they did sory of pioneer it with ac3/4
<|endoftext|>
the one all the youtuvers were jizzing over
<|endoftext|>
(because they were paid)
<|endoftext|>
It is quite good to be fair
<|endoftext|>
looks more complex/refined than the ac stuff
<|endoftext|>
Oh the boarding bit looks like non-ship bits aren't playable
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
or like a 2d guns of icarus
<|endoftext|>
with weird loot mechanics
<|endoftext|>
the one from the microsoft conference looks better
<|endoftext|>
Yeah. Looked like it wanted to be fun. And also part of the pirate idea is adventuring of the ship
<|endoftext|>
random kraken encounters tho
<|endoftext|>
Yeah that seems cool

What is everyone's favourite thing at e3 so far?
<|endoftext|>
the porche 911 2018
<|endoftext|>
that horror game where they bathe in jizz
<|endoftext|>
The most powerfull 9/11 since 2001
<|endoftext|>
the bit with the good looking games,     oh wait
<|endoftext|>
but why the fuck was it there?! i don't understand
<|endoftext|>
there was alot of good looking games but i just cant remember any that grabbed me
<|endoftext|>
Because Exclusive!
<|endoftext|>
dishonored, hoping for some good far cry shit after this
<|endoftext|>
urgh dishonerd
<|endoftext|>
I liked the look of the new dishonored too
<|endoftext|>
here we go
<|endoftext|>
farcry?
<|endoftext|>
ya
<|endoftext|>
far cry's corpse has been thouragly floged to the point where it is just a bucket of guts begging to be thrown out
<|endoftext|>
only with 4 and primal
<|endoftext|>
first 3 were awesome
<|endoftext|>
*do you know the definition of mo-on-ney*
<|endoftext|>
And 4 isn't bad just not innovative in the slightest
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
He said fuck how cool!
<|endoftext|>
ultimate gangstas
<|endoftext|>
team tactics system
<|endoftext|>
I like the town area. All the others were purley rural in gameplay
<|endoftext|>
yeah same. looks pretty, frame rate is kinda choppy atm
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
problem with farcry is its ubi

oh and battlefront mickey, forgot before. why is that an issue?

<|endoftext|>
they updates the bot! never could do more than one word
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
oh no
<|endoftext|>
beyond good and evil i think
<|endoftext|>
yeah you were right
<|endoftext|>
i never played 1, was it good? those  atching tshirts
<|endoftext|>
wow that super emotional trailer
<|endoftext|>
ikr
<|endoftext|>
made me cry
<|endoftext|>
dunno. Someone on one of the podcasts I listen to is super into it. I think the guy crying has been trying to get the game made for like a decade
<|endoftext|>
cool for him then
<|endoftext|>
again i remind you: ubisoft
<|endoftext|>
why is that an issue?
<|endoftext|>
because them and ea are the cancer on the gaming industry
<|endoftext|>
don't be a stereotype, they're all businesses who want all of our money, doesn't mean they can't make/publish cool shit
<|endoftext|>
why?
<|endoftext|>
also none of the stuff you've said that for has been first party
<|endoftext|>
I'd argue activison and ea are worse
<|endoftext|>
activision too
<|endoftext|>
or at least just as bad if not worse
<|endoftext|>
why was rondey in that game teaser
<|endoftext|>
good joke
<|endoftext|>
get it out joschy
<|endoftext|>
why does ubisoft still use the ubi launcher,  why do they make indentical ripoff 'open (empty) world' 'games',  dlc, why do they insit on charging 60¬£ for broken games which never get patched
<|endoftext|>
etc
<|endoftext|>
that's not them though, they're a business and people have proven over and over that they're still trow money at a good cg trailer so why not take advantage of issues in the industry
<|endoftext|>
that's just good consumerism
<|endoftext|>
They're no worse than other ppublishers
<|endoftext|>
WB is super bad as well
<|endoftext|>
exactly thats why you shouldn't buy their games
<|endoftext|>
ok but then we don't get to play any games
<|endoftext|>
bc everyone's like this
<|endoftext|>
also the whole thing about showing off games with sick graphics then downgrading them before the game comes out
<|endoftext|>
Again they all do that
<|endoftext|>
that's more to do with making cg trailers and then the game not being 8k cg and people being surprised by that for some reason. also bc pc has only become as popular as it is in the past few years and consoles couldn't run anything which looked good but all demos were on a pc
<|endoftext|>
rember the whole watchdogs thing
<|endoftext|>
i like niall's random reactoins to a conversation he's not part of
<|endoftext|>
in 2013?
<|endoftext|>
let it go
<|endoftext|>
its what they do for all games
<|endoftext|>
Look at any other publisher also Mass effect andromeda Batman Arkham knight just to name 2. They're bad yes but again so are all AAA publishers
<|endoftext|>
exactly
<|endoftext|>

Quality is like 96% watchable
<|endoftext|>
think its just a bit worse quality then a dvd
<|endoftext|>
occasional russian when english text appears
<|endoftext|>
i guess it's fine, but it's on a slight slant and the audio has no depth at all. ty though, i'll probably still watch
<|endoftext|>
wait, that film has been available to rent on youtube since it came out. how has nobody just used OBS to capture it?
<|endoftext|>
seems like a lot of wasted potential ad money
<|endoftext|>
you can still watch it in cinemas
<|endoftext|>
also it isn't on youtube

<|endoftext|>
No chance for a decent future CPU upgrade with that socket but you can game
<|endoftext|>
You are way below the lowest sweet spot
<|endoftext|>
And jeez. How many tabs do you need
<|endoftext|>
The GPU is a good tho
<|endoftext|>
what do you mean by the lowest sweet spot?
<|endoftext|>
The spot where you get best band for the buck
<|endoftext|>
@Laxxy you could get a 7xxx series intel cpu for a little more and then get a different motherboard for about the same price on socket 1151, and change that RAM for DDR4 (roughly the same price)  i would then look for a skylake cpu which can compete with that fx-6300 and spring for the extra cost. a competetive cpu wouldn't cost a huge amount more, but socket 1151 would mean you could use any 7th gen cpu down the line and already being on ddr4 means you won't have to buy new ram for like 5 years unless you want more  btw feel free to look for used on ebay for CPU and GPU, especially newer ones, as it will make virtually no difference except for price, and you may be able to get a 1060 for ¬£170
<|endoftext|>
The thing is the only reason that I'm getting the 6300 CPU and the motherboard is because Patrick is giving it to me for ¬£40, I'm trying to keep the budget lower than ¬£400 so my parents don't kill me. Also I've found a 1050ti for ¬£120 on eBay brand new. Right now even after finding all the cheapest prices on each part it comes to ¬£390ish
<|endoftext|>
I plan to get a better motherboard for Eid which is in a few weeks
<|endoftext|>
'better' motherboard is pointless, i was recommending a newer architecture but you'll struggle with ¬£400. get a better gpu later on. also if you're on that tight of a budget then you might want to look at buying an older office desktop like a dell optiplex from ebay and throwing a GPU in there. probably get an ssd for it too. you should be able to get one for ¬£150-ish which gives you like ¬£200 for gpu potentially. just something worth looking into, can be better value for money at the low end

<|endoftext|>
look
<|endoftext|>
Yaya
<|endoftext|>
Just wanted to see what cpu was in it
<|endoftext|>
not super clear but it looks like a quad core, and it's at 3ghz, so it also would be useable. you can always get something better though

yeah?

just noticed it was yesterday but still

he seems to really want to go to 42s
<|endoftext|>
he has nothing to do, he rejected that job
<|endoftext|>
he was also being a real dick about it after i told him he probably shouldn't so i blocked him to shut him up
<|endoftext|>
possibly why he's not in the server anymore, since i'm owner/admin

you blocked him on your friends list

<|endoftext|>
@Rodney you end up buying destiny then? comes out tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
should i buy it?
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's great. Looks like battlefront is going to rape you with microtransactions so probably go destiny over that
<|endoftext|>
does destinty not have them too
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
Kinda, nothing like battlefront
<|endoftext|>
Download is 36gb so you can probably join me tonight if you want, I'm on my way home now

<|endoftext|>
Nice, I'll whisper you when I'm on, see how far your download is
<|endoftext|>
cool
<|endoftext|>
started?
<|endoftext|>
get my battle.net message?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
got a gig to go
<|endoftext|>
alright nice. think you have to do the intro before you can do multiplyer anyway
<|endoftext|>
"The Rat King's Crew runs to and fro, good girls and boys know where to go, pick up your toys and daron your socks, on errands of woe, on errands we walk" - Complete three Patrol Missions with a Fireteam of at least one other Guardian - to do this, you need to complete the Patrol quest, granted by Cayde in the EDZ after you've finished the main story questline. Then, any two Patrol Missions will do, as long as there's at least one other Guardian in your Fireteam. "The Rat King's Crew goes arm in arm, to fight as one, to do no harm, so have your fun and run outside, rally the flag and we'll never die" - Complete two Public Events with a Fireteam of at least one other Guardian - this is one of the simplest steps. Simply head to any Public Event with a Fireteam and crack on. "The Rat King's Crew goes four and four, with good good fights they learn to score, then three as one they stand upright, return from past the wall and wanting more" - Complete two Crucible matches with a Fireteam of at least one other Guardian - again, dead simple. Head to the Crucible with your Fireteam and crack on! Both Quickplay and Competitive will work. "The Rat King's Crew stands three as one, they see Night's fall and fear it none, but watch the clock as you scale the wall, lest five remain hope comes for none" - Complete the Nightfall Strike with at least five minutes remaining - and here's where it gets tough. This is taking most players several tries, because having at least five minutes remaining on the clock, even though you can stall its progress, is no easy feat. Our advice is to wait until a week where you can complete it comfortably without worrying about the clock, and then running it over and over, refining your approach until you get it. Being as high level as possible also helps, so ensure you get as close to the max Power level cap as a Fireteam. Good luck!
<|endoftext|>
Erm what?
<|endoftext|>
Destiny 2?
<|endoftext|>
yea
<|endoftext|>
Don't worry about it, it's for tomorrow

@Rodney should be back/on for just gone 7, train has been awful. Still coming? Xur is back
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Which bit is confusing you
<|endoftext|>
7 is a time
<|endoftext|>
the whole statement
<|endoftext|>
Trains are a transport
<|endoftext|>
Xur is the destiny guy
<|endoftext|>
so you will be on at 7 ?
<|endoftext|>
Roughly
<|endoftext|>
ok
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney train got a lot worse, i'll be on in 10/15

it's interesting. in the one i just watched they were talking about that noise that dustin makes in s2. apparently that wasn't in the script at all and the kid just started doing it bc he thought it was funny
<|endoftext|>
also why are scout rifles suddenly the rarest thing in this whole game
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney are you getting the expansions when they come out?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
No clue, I only started noticing recently
<|endoftext|>
yeah same. cool either way üòÉ always glad for free stuff
<|endoftext|>
Yeah Its nice, there was a couple before when I started posting them that happened quite quickly too (killer is dead, civ3 complete, and guns of Icarus) but I feel like it's because it's the holiday part of the year so they're doing it for a promo
<|endoftext|>
makes sense
<|endoftext|>
Mhm either way it's nice, im enjoying it
<|endoftext|>
still need to play sanctum at some point. destiny expansion came out at a bad time haha, got so much i've been meaning to play
<|endoftext|>
Yeah there's a lot I've been wanting to do too, probably personally will never get round to half of it but oh well
<|endoftext|>

@everyone üò¢
<|endoftext|>

Nice haha
<|endoftext|>
i couldn't speak much but rod is making religious victory very hard because he isn't spawning Religious troops for me to fight
<|endoftext|>
if one religion beats the other in a single battle then nearby cities take influence changes
<|endoftext|>
but he no spawn
<|endoftext|>
He doesn't have a religion, those are from a civ he murdered. He has the units they had at the time but he doesn't own the religion so can't spawn more
<|endoftext|>
well shit
<|endoftext|>
that makes my job reallyy tedious
<|endoftext|>
it cost alot more faith to by units capable of destroying other religions influence
<|endoftext|>
Yep, enjoy

<|endoftext|>
Yeah the one where he attacks large critical review websites like IGN and stuff was very well done
<|endoftext|>
I love everything but the LoL stuff

another of louie's top tips: windows 10 is shitty and won't upgrade from home to pro unless you disable your internet connection, force the upgrade, and then activate it with your (perfectly legit) product code after the upgrade

Steam early access idea: a battle Royale where you aim to die first and the last person standing loses
<|endoftext|>
Nobody would kill anyone
<|endoftext|>
ill shout awful shit at you in the voice chat, you hussy
<|endoftext|>
kill  me, you won't. lil bitch
<|endoftext|>
do it
<|endoftext|>
shoot coward, you're only taking a life

Maybe the first and last die

The first and last to die lose *

you just created a social shit posting game the likes we haven't seen since vr chat's inception
<|endoftext|>
every day we stray further from god's light üåû
<|endoftext|>
that's the plan niall üòÉ
<|endoftext|>
and you can find ways around the map to kill yourself but it's actually hard
<|endoftext|>
or hope that someone kills you
<|endoftext|>
maybe you lose if someone kills you so you still have to be careful but you have to find a way to do it yourself

<|endoftext|>
+ rod has time to get the train if we plan now
<|endoftext|>
pimps is not a role in this server, but i'm down
<|endoftext|>
Not yet
<|endoftext|>
not ever
<|endoftext|>
[you have no power here meme]
<|endoftext|>
im too broke
<|endoftext|>
Then fix it
<|endoftext|>
I'm down
<|endoftext|>
Tight, we gotta find a replacement for rodney
<|endoftext|>
anyone got any actual friends?
<|endoftext|>
i'm not bringing anyone from work to meet you creeps
<|endoftext|>
Come on rod
<|endoftext|>
Y'know you wanna hang
<|endoftext|>
we can do rounds rod, 4 drinks for the price of 4
<|endoftext|>
If you can't afford the train just cycle
<|endoftext|>
or walk, you got all day
<|endoftext|>
order a taxi and run when it's time to pay
<|endoftext|>
(unless he locks you in then your fucked)
<|endoftext|>
tbh if a taxi driver locks you in then you're fucked either way, he's defo gonna rape you
<|endoftext|>
You guys are dodgy
<|endoftext|>
Yes daddy
<|endoftext|>
it's dodgy to try and avoid rape by being aware?
<|endoftext|>
sorry rod
<|endoftext|>
üåà *The More You Know*
<|endoftext|>
*The Less You Get Raped* üå†
<|endoftext|>
this is true
<|endoftext|>
The more you rape the more you know how not to get raped
<|endoftext|>
wtf
<|endoftext|>
why
<|endoftext|>
Same logic
<|endoftext|>
I was more questioning why I even stay on this server
<|endoftext|>
The more you stay on this server the more you know your not to get raped
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous i apologise for starting this conversation
<|endoftext|>
what's happening tomorrow then? where we going? if no rod then we could do chorlton
<|endoftext|>
I just realised i turned discord off.
<|endoftext|>
1) Rodney that's not logical
<|endoftext|>
2) Do whatever, i know a few cool places in town tho - rod can attest.
<|endoftext|>
i have stuff on until a bit later than i thought tonight, we can either go out a bit later or it might be an idea to go tomorrow instead
<|endoftext|>
I can go late
<|endoftext|>
i have a driving lesson finishing at 8, we good to go in chorlton then? i might even be able to finish my lesson near josches
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous good with that?
<|endoftext|>
There's nothing to do in chorlton
<|endoftext|>
gonna have to be tomorrow then
<|endoftext|>
you could just get the tram
<|endoftext|>
Places in manchester don't even open til gone ten
<|endoftext|>
where did you wanna go?
<|endoftext|>
I know a cool place to play pool for a bit and then we could go to a bar or somethin
<|endoftext|>
where is pool?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
looks cool, i suck at pool though.
<|endoftext|>
I'm not great
<|endoftext|>
rod and me missed alot
<|endoftext|>
(there's also table tennis if you want that instead)
<|endoftext|>
i look like a chink to you
<|endoftext|>
The place is renovated strip club
<|endoftext|>
That's racist
<|endoftext|>
:Empty_Glass:  Empty glass for you
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
nice blizzard outside today ‚ùÑ
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Hire some people
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
does anyone own a heat gun?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Moving truck for a single pc
<|endoftext|>
for his pc you nonce
<|endoftext|>
^^ this is why we have an oxford student in here, he has the smart ideas
<|endoftext|>
easy to move the latop that way
<|endoftext|>
I say glue wheels to the underside of the computer

<|endoftext|>
snow terrorists
<|endoftext|>
wtf is this weather
<|endoftext|>
are you writing a bible nial?
<|endoftext|>
discord should have switched server locations if one branch went down, you probs just didn't get switched actively - update your discord maybe
<|endoftext|>
like the app went down for everyone
<|endoftext|>
wasn't one server
<|endoftext|>
nope
<|endoftext|>
it didn't close or anything, it just refused to send messages
<|endoftext|>
discord is rich enough to have load balancing
<|endoftext|>
i get the grey waiting msgs sometimes
<|endoftext|>
it's usually my internet
<|endoftext|>
not a server issue then
<|endoftext|>
get your shit right
<|endoftext|>
sorry, the _service_ went down, nobs
<|endoftext|>

not exactly what i meant
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
wtf
<|endoftext|>
ghost of a meeseeks
<|endoftext|>
done again in settings
<|endoftext|>
think it was just backed up commands, it was gone the first time
<|endoftext|>
it's called webhooks for some reason instead of bot
<|endoftext|>
webhooks is a generic thing
<|endoftext|>
what did you do?
<|endoftext|>
I kicked it but didn't work so i went into settings and deleted the bot or webhook
<|endoftext|>
might have messed up all the other bots, we'll see
<|endoftext|>
they all use webhooks is all
<|endoftext|>
other bots are fine, i think the webhook was just not kicked and that was what was doing the auto msgs
<|endoftext|>
alrighty, fair enough

<|endoftext|>
printworks is ¬£5, I'm surprised
<|endoftext|>
show some emotion üòÆ
<|endoftext|>
(it's been like this since september everywhere)
<|endoftext|>
it's a strange move i think is meant to prevent more people from just pirating
<|endoftext|>
Should probably just go printworks then
<|endoftext|>
:speig:
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
```css so apparently you can inject css into discord messages ```
<|endoftext|>
yah, discord and it's rivals are used alot in offices
<|endoftext|>
slack has alot of coder options
<|endoftext|>
i've been trying to push for it at work, we use skype ü§¢
<|endoftext|>
lue you watch APBio?
<|endoftext|>
no, good?
<|endoftext|>
it;s funny,. More normal tv than Sunny but still weird enough and dry enough
<|endoftext|>
oh is this where glenn howerton might be going?
<|endoftext|>
??? He's there
<|endoftext|>
he might be leaving always sunnny
<|endoftext|>
Damn
<|endoftext|>
I guess they're running on empty with the senario now and wanna branch out (Day already has)
<|endoftext|>
Might be great idea to take an couple year break then continue
<|endoftext|>
yeah maybe. he's contracted for 2 more afaik, this year's was delayed while he was working on something else and then it might end after s13
<|endoftext|>
is everyone free monday? (not tomorrow)
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I'm free then
<|endoftext|>
Where will you be living?
<|endoftext|>
Sale
<|endoftext|>
Nice
<|endoftext|>
near Dane Road stop so you can get there easy, i'll let you know closer to the time what's happening
<|endoftext|>
Join my circle of trust
<|endoftext|>
what?
<|endoftext|>
This new thing on reddit.
<|endoftext|>
Did you not receive your own circle ?
<|endoftext|>
wtf is this
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
I don't see ought
<|endoftext|>
dSKHGKdMydtHyTaPgDbzGKp%pPsXSGebXrTyr4dGzrknFAFKStsEDMkScWWtSGtp
<|endoftext|>
that's my key
<|endoftext|>
@Misery
<|endoftext|>
I.ve seen two circles now
<|endoftext|>
how do i see a different circle?
<|endoftext|>
I'm not logged in and when i try to click pages i get a circle of trust on that new page
<|endoftext|>
Nice key
<|endoftext|>
thanks, i generated it for security
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney explain
<|endoftext|>
You get a single circle. You give keys for people to join. I guess the biggest circle wins something. If someone gets the key they can decide to betray the circle, breaking it
<|endoftext|>
Hot as fuck
<|endoftext|>
One circle per person. If it's broken it's dead
<|endoftext|>
I agree, let's start killing random reddit users and hope to steal their circles
<|endoftext|>
Great idea Rodney Mutanga :RodInTheHat:
<|endoftext|>
No killing Niall
<|endoftext|>
I was just following your idea
<|endoftext|>
The blood's on your hands
<|endoftext|>
hey, spot the issue with this code:
<|endoftext|>
String.prototype.rtrim = function() {     return this.replace(/\s+$/,""); }
<|endoftext|>
/
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
i meant in terms of the dev was a fucking idiot, it parses fine
<|endoftext|>
i'll give you a hint, it's a function called RTRIM which just spent 30 mins fucking me off and it's in the firmware for my router as part of the password validation
<|endoftext|>
I've never use rtrim
<|endoftext|>
it's _meant_ to trim all of the whitespace to the right of a string
<|endoftext|>
look at what that line actually does
<|endoftext|>
then look at this bullshit
<|endoftext|>
but more importantly, look at _why_ that now fails
<|endoftext|>
the dollar is deleted
<|endoftext|>
White space 4 life
<|endoftext|>
no, it becomes too short for the validation
<|endoftext|>
Weird use of rtrim
<|endoftext|>
so what happens if i type a 9 or more char password with a dollar sign in it?
<|endoftext|>
function needs replacing
<|endoftext|>
well yeah, but if i type a 9 or more char password with a dollar sign in it then i'm locked out of my router forever because it's removed the dollar sign without telling me but it meets validation so the altered string still goes through
<|endoftext|>
the character limit needs to be the final validation loop if you want to actively remove characters (if this wasn't a password thing)
<|endoftext|>
it is, which is why it failed the first time, but if i choose a pw that's long enough without the dollar signs then i'm fucked because it passes that final validation
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
yep :/
<|endoftext|>
so in related news guess who just had to factory reset his whole network
<|endoftext|>
Home or work?
<|endoftext|>
home
<|endoftext|>
we don't use virgin shit at work
<|endoftext|>
Virgin tec support has gotten better over time tho, they have replaced everyone with robots
<|endoftext|>
clearly they replaced their devs with high schoolers
<|endoftext|>
oh and on top of all that, because this is in the rtrim function, if i copy my pw and it has a fuckload of whitespace then it never gets removed and makes it into my final password
<|endoftext|>
ty for your input joschy ‚ù§
<|endoftext|>
Empty_Glass means you hate it. milk is love

Louie enters the scene, but whats this? Jocsh is there too.  "Do you remember that thing that happened 10 years ago? The one that seemed like it would split us apart forever, but instead brought us closer then ever? That brought us......to each-other?"  "The time with the Dildo?"  "Yes!" "Oh, yes right"  "Its hard to believe what happened isn't it? What happened and what it led to" "Yes my sweetness" said Jocsh, giving Louie a "special" kiss. "Now that I have remembered it again I will never forget it." "It was pretty life changing."  So we now dim our headlights and reverse drive back to the presence, the mists closing back around the future and the camera of our mind drawing back to the world we know of as the now. Far far away, in a magical far away distant land.. -- ............................................
<|endoftext|>
One day Louie was doing Quidditch...  One night Louie had been drinking too much gin.   He felt very nice and enjoyed it very much.  Then all the sudden he saw a stranger walking.   Not just any stranger because real strangers dont exist!   This one was evil!  Louie ran to stranger and hit them, it was The Jews!   "How dare you..you.. villain! I kill you by murder!"   "Yes, we fight now!"   "No, I will take over your body and rape you!"
<|endoftext|>
So not to fall out of fashion they both stripped and squeezed into their most gothyest clothing. Louie had to admit that NIRRL looked kind of sexy in that outfit of his. But Louie didn't dare to comment on that  (Louie had only just discovered he was bi, and was a little angxious over that. He wans't sure if his othre friends would accept that!.
<|endoftext|>
accurate
<|endoftext|>
Lol wtf

Oh no! gasped Rodney and she felt really bad for Niall because even though she knew that Niall didn't love her and was really depressed, she really didn't expect this. And Rodney was also shocked because he knew the Rodney and Rodney knew a great secret that he didn't know, he still didn't know it was going to be this kind of secret! Niall felt very depressed all the sudden. He lost the will to fight and dropped his weapon before Louie and villain laughed very loudly.  Louie then said: "I have you now under my omplete spell like I had that so long ago!"  (A/N I wanted a cliff hanger here but I'm sooooo excited to share the next but of story with you! " )
<|endoftext|>
"I am glade we found a way to survive all that and still be together" "Yes, our plan seems to have worked despite all the events" "Do you think anyone spotted us?" "No" "No" "Yes" Louie emerged from the shadows of the darkness. "I know everything" he said.  Niall and Rodney gasped. Their secret was finally revealed!
<|endoftext|>
üëå :you_dont_say:
<|endoftext|>
"I dont love Rodney like you do" said Louie"but I have always lusted a bit after them. So you see if Rodney spends the night with me - I will never tell anyone." Niall breathed a sigh of relief. That was, after all, a reasonable request. They agreed to the bargain. "Phwee...thats something we can go along with" said Rodney relieved. Louie was happy, and Niall and Rodney thus got to live happily ever after together. With no one but Louie and themselves ever knowing.

how's everyone's sql? daddy's stuck and google isn't helping
<|endoftext|>
not good
<|endoftext|>
i use https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp
<|endoftext|>
thanks, the sql i write for work is a bit more advanced than that though üòõ
<|endoftext|>
scroll down on left
<|endoftext|>
can't find what i'm looking for üò¢
<|endoftext|>
it's a scope issue
<|endoftext|>
declare @secondaryID varchar(255)='1', @currenttable varchar(255) = 'users', @currentcolumn varchar(255)='id', @name varchar(255)='DisplayName', @datatomove varchar(255)     exec(N'set @datatomove = (select ' + @name + ' from ' + @currenttable + ' where ' + @currentcolumn + ' = ' + @secondaryID + ')')
<|endoftext|>
as an example
<|endoftext|>
@datatomove doesn't exist in the exec
<|endoftext|>
I've never seen datamove, this sql looks weird to me. Try changing the variables with static values for a test
<|endoftext|>
won't make a difference, they aren't declared. Basically i need to assign a variable to the result of a query that can change depending on where i am in a loop
<|endoftext|>
I think sql has built in functions that could be used to accomplish this
<|endoftext|>
i would love to know about them, shame their documentation sucks balls

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
The casting for the live action teen titans is awful; the youngest looks 30, the costumes are shit and nobodies green or orange
<|endoftext|>
How dare you, what about that pink girl who looks like a prostitute
<|endoftext|>
Why is she Starfire ?
<|endoftext|>
And the beastboy is wrong
<|endoftext|>
At least he has green hair Niall
<|endoftext|>

It hurts to watch how out of touch or how lacking in common sense some of the senators are
<|endoftext|>
There was like 4 Q's in different iterations that got asked like 30 or 40 times

It was a *Zuccing* cakewalk for him

I'm not sure the 'will you change your business model' was an invalid question, she was asking if they are willing to move away from ads as a source of revenue in the interest of privacy
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  @Louie1505  want to play ow?
<|endoftext|>

Crippling the company in the short term and massively effecting revenue in the long term
<|endoftext|>
She we pretty much asking him to not profit for 3 months and invest in a massive infrastructure change
<|endoftext|>
No buisness at that size in their right mind would change
<|endoftext|>
change your business model doesn't mean have no business model
<|endoftext|>
Which would Short term cripple 'em as they transitioned and after the transition they would have to work out the kinks. Costing them for deploying the change and gaining less rev after
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous apparently i have to go somewhere in the morning so probably gonna leave it for tonight if that's alright - when did you say you're going back?
<|endoftext|>
Probably Monday
<|endoftext|>
eughhh, font for a bit?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Could go to town...?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Company getting rid of old hardware cheap I guess?
<|endoftext|>
*fast
<|endoftext|>
yeah exactly, because of spectre/meltdown there's a load of hardware on ebay that won't be getting intel updates so can't be used in a business and is super cheap
<|endoftext|>
perfectly good for me though
<|endoftext|>
Where'd you get it?
<|endoftext|>
Wouldnt mind hardware like that
<|endoftext|>
ebay
<|endoftext|>
Ah
<|endoftext|>
also you can get the same xeons for like ¬£12 sine CPUs are the most affected by the issues

The Cellar has live music
<|endoftext|>
I gotta be honest i don't give a shit where we go as long as it has people around our age there
<|endoftext|>
I doubt the cellar will, you want town for that
<|endoftext|>
The cellar does it's just not very good live music
<|endoftext|>
Old market tavern looks cool and cheap
<|endoftext|>
maybe dylan will be playing
<|endoftext|>
If he still lives
<|endoftext|>
fair point
<|endoftext|>
old market tavern look lie an old people pub
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Nope
<|endoftext|>
Not one
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
It gets worse the more you read
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Oh... happy .... days

<|endoftext|>
I found two free bands, one does mowtoon and the other *African, Indie, Pop, World Music*
<|endoftext|>
5ths
<|endoftext|>
what's wrong with that?
<|endoftext|>
we tried 42's but the lines massive, rodney didnt' get to try it
<|endoftext|>
5ths has weird people
<|endoftext|>
only worth going if there's and event on, or you're on some form of drug
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
If she's still warm you're good to go
<|endoftext|>
Yep
<|endoftext|>
How's your evening going? Nails already got laid twice and I got spitroasted
<|endoftext|>
Not bad.
<|endoftext|>
Niall briefly hit on some chicks and then they ditched him, it was great
<|endoftext|>
I felt nothing and strangely everything
<|endoftext|>
Your turn next rod
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
And yes im am home safe thanks for asking
<|endoftext|>
What does that mean?
<|endoftext|>
He's referring to the fact that they let him feel up nothing but we're wearing few enough clothes that he could still feel everything
<|endoftext|>
There was no suspense because, although they were attractive enough, i was not invested in the pull
<|endoftext|>
You should have come rod
<|endoftext|>
You made us drink shots you bastard rodney
<|endoftext|>
One was attractive
<|endoftext|>
Yeah
<|endoftext|>
I'll come next time Def

<|endoftext|>
But seriously it's still called coursework
<|endoftext|>
idk. i dont feel motivated to play
<|endoftext|>
i look at it and dont get the feels
<|endoftext|>
we were just getting to the good items, you should play one more time to get yo money's worth
<|endoftext|>
It's more fun when you get powerful
<|endoftext|>
@everyone anyone know somewhere in manchester that does old hardware cheap? Daddy needs an x58 board and people online have no idea what hardware from 2011 is worth
<|endoftext|>
I dont think you will have any luck with that
<|endoftext|>
Possibly, don't want to listen to that server all the time
<|endoftext|>
@Misery listened to the new AM album yet? it's weird af
<|endoftext|>
I chose to listen to Blossoms today, it's very good - a more mellow sound but still great. I'll give it a listen now
<|endoftext|>
not on youtube or anything yet, hasitleaked.com has links
<|endoftext|>
It sounds like there's two different bands playing their own instrumental with a slow AM song vocal on top
<|endoftext|>
ikr
<|endoftext|>
She Looks Like Fun is like half OK
<|endoftext|>
yeah there's like 2 that are
<|endoftext|>
I gotta say i don't like half of the suck it and see album
<|endoftext|>
AM felt inconsitant to me too, so i wasn't expecting much
<|endoftext|>
idk about half but that's probably the one that i like the smallest percentage of. AM was different but i liked it
<|endoftext|>
apart from mad sounds, that one sucks
<|endoftext|>
I liked AM but i don't like liking it
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
it's like rod and his horses
<|endoftext|>
such a guilty pleasure
<|endoftext|>
he wishes he could give them up
<|endoftext|>
Latest Silicon Valley ep (s5ep7) felt better written then the rest of the season with more normal jokes
<|endoftext|>
Maybe more different then better
<|endoftext|>
wow ok, i didn't know it was back on
<|endoftext|>
rodney told you like 2 weeks ago :RodInTheHat:
<|endoftext|>
but i don't pay attention to him
<|endoftext|>
He looked you in your cold,cold eyes and said it
<|endoftext|>
wtf, google assisstant has been given the ability to make calls to book things like haircuts on its own
<|endoftext|>
like it will call and talk to them for you
<|endoftext|>
It's crazy
<|endoftext|>
That was just a lucky example out of hundreds, we have like 2-3yrs yet til it's ok
<|endoftext|>
still insane that it can even do that
<|endoftext|>
i'm sure people will realise they're talking to a robot

<|endoftext|>
AM on jimmy fallon, it sounded bad.
<|endoftext|>
The lyrics are probably great but i can't understand them
<|endoftext|>
I liked it better on a second listen
<|endoftext|>
the lyrics are actually really good
<|endoftext|>
I can't wait until someone covers it and makes it legable
<|endoftext|>
one of the songs is talking about "selling the fact that he can't be bought, his new product called integrity"
<|endoftext|>
yup

<|endoftext|>
69 on metacritic
<|endoftext|>
no thanks
<|endoftext|>
9.4/10 on imdb
<|endoftext|>
metacritic doesn't mean shit anyway, it's an average and it includes a load of random crap which throws the numbers off
<|endoftext|>
I was joking sorry
<|endoftext|>
sorry?
<|endoftext|>
also is 7 good?
<|endoftext|>
seven is a good animated film, yes
<|endoftext|>
anyone got a good site for watching tv shows online? apparently there's more archer out
<|endoftext|>
https://ww2.gowatchseries.co/info/silicon-valley-season-5
<|endoftext|>
search for it on top right, site takes three clicks sometimes to get past ads
<|endoftext|>
i have much ad blocking...any recommendation on which server?
<|endoftext|>
any that work really, i like streammango as a preference as it usually works
<|endoftext|>
yeah i got one, ty
<|endoftext|>
archer is dog shit
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
The post is fucked up too, the dude must've felt real weird
<|endoftext|>
I just don't invite you mate
<|endoftext|>
And do I need to remind you of last time we went out
<|endoftext|>
I can talk to people at parties easily enough, i've made friends at them, i just can't pull
<|endoftext|>
So we don't need to hire someone to pretend to like you, we just need to hire a whore
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney can pay
<|endoftext|>
is it down to this?
<|endoftext|>
Hiring whores
<|endoftext|>
It was always going to end here
<|endoftext|>
We can finally accept that now
<|endoftext|>
This is how we die

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
aye, wanna play?
<|endoftext|>
Give me like 3 weeks and sure
<|endoftext|>
long time, think big rod finished today
<|endoftext|>
Lucky him
<|endoftext|>
ikr
<|endoftext|>
i finish never so
<|endoftext|>
Only been here 4 weeks this term though anyway
<|endoftext|>
yeah i guess. How's it been? anything interesting?
<|endoftext|>
the mother of Rodney's kid joined a cult, so that's fun
<|endoftext|>
Was playing croquet earlier
<|endoftext|>
course you fucking were
<|endoftext|>
Just bought it
<|endoftext|>
Not sure it'll run on my laptop anyway
<|endoftext|>
Probably doesn't even have enough space free
<|endoftext|>
sweet. yeah i doubt it, it's well optimised but it's a fancy looking game
<|endoftext|>
plays really well though, kinda light on content but still
<|endoftext|>
new windows 10 update
<|endoftext|>
trust me i've been told
<|endoftext|>
windows won't stfu
<|endoftext|>
what's in it?
<|endoftext|>
idk.
<|endoftext|>
Task view looks like the only flashy new thing
<|endoftext|>
oh I think i already have that one
<|endoftext|>
anything with tiles gets this weird effect
<|endoftext|>
thats pretty cool
<|endoftext|>
i guess
<|endoftext|>
it's like the only place it works
<|endoftext|>
settings redesign too - think it's mainly aesthetic changes
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney ow?
<|endoftext|>
I cant right now
<|endoftext|>
I gotta eat
<|endoftext|>
np
<|endoftext|>
I like the new design
<|endoftext|>
how'd you hand in go? you getting kicked out?
<|endoftext|>
Smashed it
<|endoftext|>
noice
<|endoftext|>
you need a bigger ssd mate
<|endoftext|>
yea
<|endoftext|>
you missed out on my old one, it's in the server now
<|endoftext|>
know any good deals
<|endoftext|>
'the server'?
<|endoftext|>
I'll do you a great deal
<|endoftext|>
eh?
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
well i have 2 now
<|endoftext|>
I'm only using 1
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney you got an m.2 slot?
<|endoftext|>
yea
<|endoftext|>
think my one is still ¬£99 on amazon, 256gb
<|endoftext|>
2 secs
<|endoftext|>
are m.2s faster?
<|endoftext|>
waaaay faster
<|endoftext|>
Only if they're pcie ones surely?
<|endoftext|>
this is true
<|endoftext|>
aren't the sata ones U.2 ? I thought M.2 was only NVME?
<|endoftext|>
i heard they boot slower tho
<|endoftext|>
from where? after post my pc takes 2 seconds flat
<|endoftext|>
idk
<|endoftext|>
Boot times don't really matter anyway
<|endoftext|>
compared to a 960 pro sata ssd rod
<|endoftext|>
Omg I saved 4s but everything else is slower
<|endoftext|>
so what should i go for
<|endoftext|>
up to you, you can save some money if you get a normal sata one
<|endoftext|>
are WD reputable ?
<|endoftext|>
so the right drive from that pic is 60 odd on amazon
<|endoftext|>
yeah they are
<|endoftext|>
wait WD make SSDs now?
<|endoftext|>
https://www.amazon.co.uk/WD-Black-WDS256G1X0C-High-Performance-Solid/dp/B01MS6BYJD/ref=sr_1_3?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1526674628&sr=1-3&keywords=m.2
<|endoftext|>
that one is 100% slows compared to samsung
<|endoftext|>
huh, cool. They're known for hard drives, really old brand that makes some of the best drives, never used one of they SSDs
<|endoftext|>
you could also get a second of the same ssd and raid 0 them if you wanted to live dangerously
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
not sure what kind of speeds you'd get, in theory 2x what you already have
<|endoftext|>
i think i will go with the samsung 250gb
<|endoftext|>
link?
<|endoftext|>
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-MZ-V6E250BW-250GB-Express-Solid/dp/B01M211K53/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1526674628&sr=1-1&keywords=m.2
<|endoftext|>
that's my exact drive haha, it's sweet. and for ¬£9 less than i got it too
<|endoftext|>
eddie has the same one too, think he's liking it so far
<|endoftext|>
considering getting a heatsink for mine. not necessary really but they look cool
<|endoftext|>
Why?
<|endoftext|>
it just looks good
<|endoftext|>
EK waterblocks man
<|endoftext|>
they also come in colours
<|endoftext|>
waw
<|endoftext|>
speaking of EK, have you seen their custom loop kits?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
i dont really follow
<|endoftext|>
they use all aluminium so they're cheaper, you can get a full loop for like 150
<|endoftext|>
by comparison a normal rad is usually about 50 on its own
<|endoftext|>
im guessing you need that for your 7700k at 5ghz
<|endoftext|>
it's more of a want than a need
<|endoftext|>
got my end date today so I'm gonna buy myself one for finishing my quals
<|endoftext|>
speaking of, night out on me in a few weeks, daddy gonna get a raise

windows 10 is forcing me to set up a local account password
<|endoftext|>
Weird. Didn't do that for me. Can you undo it afterwards?
<|endoftext|>
i cant
<|endoftext|>
maybe google it, not much of an issue now but it means you can't get your windows license back if you switch out some hardware
<|endoftext|>
yea I cant find anything

Apparently squirrel girl will be in it
<|endoftext|>
yep üò¶ from what ive read they are completely ignoring the comics
<|endoftext|>
they are just cherrypicking people from GreatLakes Avengers and the New warriors
<|endoftext|>
The new warriors comics aren't great but the heros background story's are, but it looks like they're gonna dumb it down cause most of them are very dark
<|endoftext|>
very dark

<|endoftext|>
Nrll's coming @Rodney
<|endoftext|>
Rod doesn't want to go to a club btw and I agree, wanna find a bar?
<|endoftext|>
ya, gutentaug
<|endoftext|>
is that a bar or are you wishing me a good day?
<|endoftext|>
but spelt wrong
<|endoftext|>
latter
<|endoftext|>
it's tag then
<|endoftext|>
know anywhere good?
<|endoftext|>
not really, the only casual place i know is the pool/pong place
<|endoftext|>
I'm good to go there for a bit? it's expensive though
<|endoftext|>
we could go to a place in sale or altringham if we're just goin to a bar
<|endoftext|>
true, idk any though
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney find a place for us
<|endoftext|>
green room? looks to be near the stop and same name as a good show
<|endoftext|>
or we can just do town again, up to you two
<|endoftext|>
I don't know any places
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  town or near here rod?
<|endoftext|>
I don't mind
<|endoftext|>
What time
<|endoftext|>
yeah but pick. 8?
<|endoftext|>
also fair waning I'm already kinda drink and I haven't had a good day so I'm getting shitfaced üòÉ
<|endoftext|>
Town?
<|endoftext|>
sure
<|endoftext|>
@(Not) Admin @Subby So where and when then? If we're just going to a bar there's no point in going to town
<|endoftext|>
town is good though, plenty of slags
<|endoftext|>
roxy's?
<|endoftext|>
expensive with bad booze
<|endoftext|>
true
<|endoftext|>
I'd go if there was an even amount of people, but with 3 the games aren't as fun
<|endoftext|>
I'm not that bothered about playing, but also that's a good opening line üòÉ
<|endoftext|>
Backup plan >>> https://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/Manchester/The-Venue-Nightclub/Circa-Waves-DJ-Set/13203689/
<|endoftext|>
i guess maybe
<|endoftext|>
I like circa waves and they're easy to listen to
<|endoftext|>
ask rod
<|endoftext|>
but also come roxy's first
<|endoftext|>
go somewhere other then roxy's, it's only fun if you're playing the games
<|endoftext|>
yeah come play pool
<|endoftext|>
rod loves playing with balls
<|endoftext|>
What time then ? And where are we meeting
<|endoftext|>
Location?
<|endoftext|>
gardens?
<|endoftext|>
Yea
<|endoftext|>
Which bar
<|endoftext|>
If we're going to a bar we don't have to go to manchester
<|endoftext|>
what do you have against town?
<|endoftext|>
Everywhere is loud and obnoxious or requires payment on the door. If we're aren't purposefully going somewhere loud, instead going to just chill in a bar, we can go anywhere. Just sayin „ÄΩ
<|endoftext|>
ok, but where?
<|endoftext|>
otherwise, town sounds good to me

Dukes and warf looks ok
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
No it should be a map with options on when clicked
<|endoftext|>
dukes is a restaurant
<|endoftext|>
(altringham has some ok places, and they're easy to walk between)
<|endoftext|>
Dukes is both resteraunt and bar
<|endoftext|>
it's only 20 mins on the tram from town
<|endoftext|>
Any else gonna recommend a place??
<|endoftext|>

new optaine DIMMs - go up to 512gb and are non-volatile so will retain data when you reboot so less waiting for stuff to copy from a drive
<|endoftext|>
yea but what are the speeds
<|endoftext|>
they aren't like actual ddr
<|endoftext|>
yeah true, but there are a lot of application where more ram is more important than fast ram, like servers
<|endoftext|>
it doesn't act like ram. its just really fast storage

Rodney, you have to aspire to be like him

waw

Though his life was probably fucked up afterwards if the greentext is true

Yeah Rodney, stop nutting in women and start doing it on them

i don't get it

is it meant to be real?
<|endoftext|>
and why is it on the fuking front page of imgur
<|endoftext|>
It is, she's a follower from NV iirc
<|endoftext|>
yeah, Cassidy caravans i chose her in my run
<|endoftext|>
that line never came up
<|endoftext|>
Clearly you never showed her your long dick
<|endoftext|>
unless the characters name is nobody's dick
<|endoftext|>
most liekley
<|endoftext|>
Main char in NV has a fucking long dick

he/she is SPECIAL

This is fun
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, in theory rebooting your router regularly can help, I have a job which does mine overnight now
<|endoftext|>
According to the article you can fix it through factory reset and also maybe installing new firmware depending on the model
<|endoftext|>
I'd rather have malware than use that virgin interface to reassign all my static ips
<|endoftext|>
Or just use some of that dev money to buy a new one of course
<|endoftext|>
Yeah I've been meaning to, I have an Asus one but it's 10/100 and I refuse to copy files at that speed
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney ow?
<|endoftext|>
ya
<|endoftext|>
Anyone have a decent picture of me? Making a tinder account
<|endoftext|>
Maybe not as a main one but that's not bad
<|endoftext|>
I only have one picture with you smiling but it clearly shows you're at college and it's not the best
<|endoftext|>
Send it? I can just photoship it onto a hot body
<|endoftext|>
shop
<|endoftext|>
whatsapped
<|endoftext|>
also blurry af haha
<|endoftext|>
i have alot of pics of you not looking impressed or doing weird stuff
<|endoftext|>
go on, I'd hate for my pictures to be a bad representation and that's about my personality
<|endoftext|>
jump in a call?
<|endoftext|>
like the lyons mask, you with a knife and such
<|endoftext|>
knife?
<|endoftext|>
yes
<|endoftext|>
and one with you next to a bed of computer parts
<|endoftext|>
why are you not sending these all
<|endoftext|>
maybe to me persoanlly though,m don't wanna spam joosh
<|endoftext|>
alot of them contain like 5% of josch's body
<|endoftext|>
i can crop, send them, I wanna see if I have something to work with
<|endoftext|>
all of my photos of me have Loren in so
<|endoftext|>
i dont have any prom photos, try yo find some
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney coming back in that call?
<|endoftext|>
@Misery <<
<|endoftext|>
none  of the ones i have are photoshopable really, your hand covers the screen or your looking away
<|endoftext|>
yeah that sounds like me
<|endoftext|>
I can't talk right now
<|endoftext|>
kk
<|endoftext|>
idk what to use, selfie is so boring and I can't take them
<|endoftext|>
finding a prom photo is a safe bet, ask rod, josch or sharnelle. Ill take picture of you with my drone when you least expect it
<|endoftext|>
I don't think anyone took pictures of me
<|endoftext|>
sharnelle is now not alllowed phones, they're the devil's work
<|endoftext|>
yeah I suck at this
<|endoftext|>
@Misery do this with me btw? Could go to things together, makes it less weird for both parties
<|endoftext|>
i need a new phone, tinder don't exist in my app store
<|endoftext|>
think there's one called timber, it's a client for it?
<|endoftext|>
also you have an ipod right?
<|endoftext|>
A random dude in Imgur told me I have a beautiful taste in memes and he would cherish them forever so yeah how much worse than that is everyone else's day going?
<|endoftext|>
why stick soo long with a shit "phone"

'Hung like a horse. Don't believe me? Give me a happy ending and i can give you half a gallon of proof

<|endoftext|>
Watch out predetors
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
You reckon their opening line is them taking credit for their part in the creation?
<|endoftext|>
I think it's one of them over explaining that rape is bad, to a really suspicious degree
<|endoftext|>
@Misery you remember that woman I used to work with right? I've mentioned her before?
<|endoftext|>
ahuh
<|endoftext|>
she offered me money for sex and I'm not 100% sure she's joking

DEAD
<|endoftext|>
Yes
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Kinda worried, but then it could just mean tired or something and then I'd look like an idiot if I got in touch
<|endoftext|>
who si it
<|endoftext|>
I'm sure you can figure that out from context
<|endoftext|>
I think it's what people put during an emotional overload
<|endoftext|>
like a really emotionally stressful situation, like finding out rodney was adopted
<|endoftext|>
Whatthefuckismyname!!!!!
<|endoftext|>
WTF DEAD
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Meh
<|endoftext|>
im still interested
<|endoftext|>
meh
<|endoftext|>
looks too destinyish for me, combat scenarios just churned out instead of a meticulous campaign. Just fly like 100metres away and fire explosives
<|endoftext|>
good point
<|endoftext|>
is that it?
<|endoftext|>
wheres battlefield5
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I don't have to go anywhere until like 1pm tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
Fair enough
<|endoftext|>
They just showed like a 5min indie montage and it was better than the conference
<|endoftext|>
Yeah they do that every year
<|endoftext|>
they usually show like 3 of them but the just like stuffed some great looking games like Ashen into 20second slots while cars got 20min
<|endoftext|>
Cool, I'll watch after work
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
For a week (before I can play good games)
<|endoftext|>
I mean non racing games
<|endoftext|>
*taxing
<|endoftext|>
As only got laptop
<|endoftext|>
When all four of us are online i wanna play Codenames, it's a browser game
<|endoftext|>
Puzzle game. Two teams. In each one guy gives a clue corresponding to a word grid and the guessor has to guess the corressponding words from the grid
<|endoftext|>
It's alot more fun then i sounds cause it causes alot of fights
<|endoftext|>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8-BASSb0bQ
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
too competitive
<|endoftext|>
fair enough
<|endoftext|>
yeah the Rage 2 thing was weird Nile
<|endoftext|>
Crowd was great, some of them were horrified and disturbed
<|endoftext|>
I was loving it
<|endoftext|>
jamming at my desk
<|endoftext|>
I was asked to leave the office
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Yeah, i need to play normal prey
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
oooh, they invented prop hunt too
<|endoftext|>
The mimics  were part of the game but it was weirdly announced
<|endoftext|>
What did I do?
<|endoftext|>
acting like you don't know? you disgust me
<|endoftext|>
proof
<|endoftext|>
Shit, undeniable
<|endoftext|>
cool pic
<|endoftext|>
God Howard has returned to us
<|endoftext|>
so we're all getting fallout 76 right? looks awesome
<|endoftext|>
Haven't played any previous fallout games so probably not
<|endoftext|>
doubt you'll need to, but you should play them
<|endoftext|>
it's a prequel anyway
<|endoftext|>
yeah I'm getting the collectors edition of this
<|endoftext|>
daddy needs a power armour helmet
<|endoftext|>
elder scrolls blades looks cool too - I have ejaculated far too many times in this conference
<|endoftext|>
.
<|endoftext|>
.
<|endoftext|>
.
<|endoftext|>
will one of you buy me this shirt please
<|endoftext|>
Anyone gonna watch the PC conference?
<|endoftext|>
nah it sucks
<|endoftext|>
It's got some good strategy games each year and there are some good indie releases. Like Enter the Gungeon
<|endoftext|>
yeah but the show itself is always bad, I'll just watch a summary tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
really don't like the talk show format
<|endoftext|>
It's a bit slow but i like it better than the other conferences. There is no cringe, just a room full of old nerds
<|endoftext|>
You think we happy few is ever coming out?
<|endoftext|>
it was like remade from the ground up when microsoft bought them, it was for of the e3 show
<|endoftext|>
Oh really? Did they take the survival bs out?
<|endoftext|>
I know it got pulled from steam a little while ago, probably when they got bought in hindsight
<|endoftext|>
watch the soft e3 thing it was like a 2min cinematic and a 2min speech
<|endoftext|>
Watching now, that's why I mentioned it
<|endoftext|>
Not sure I'm up to him talking about it
<|endoftext|>
ubi pulled out Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a panda furry and a fat evil kenevil
<|endoftext|>
No giraffe this year?
<|endoftext|>
panda instead
<|endoftext|>
Ah, makes sense
<|endoftext|>
Master chief collection coming later this year? Are they re releasing or something?
<|endoftext|>
halo infinite, no word on mcc
<|endoftext|>
The faststart lady just said it
<|endoftext|>
oh
<|endoftext|>
fasttostart is unessecary
<|endoftext|>
You're unnecessary
<|endoftext|>
New tr looks fun
<|endoftext|>
Looks worse than rise though somehow, hope those aren't final graphics
<|endoftext|>
a good version of sea of thieves is being made by ubi
<|endoftext|>
they teased it last e3
<|endoftext|>
looks aright
<|endoftext|>
Oh sweet, even uplay is better than the windows store
<|endoftext|>
2077 trailer did look cool, pretty sure we won't see it in our lifetime though
<|endoftext|>
Realm Royal seems like a good BR game
<|endoftext|>
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-13-we-watched-50-minutes-of-uncut-cyberpunk-2077-gameplay-and-interviewed-cd-projekt-about-it
<|endoftext|>
dowegettowatchthe50mins?
<|endoftext|>
ohshit
<|endoftext|>
space was stuck
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
Idk if we can, the interview at the bottom is interesting though
<|endoftext|>
the art style looked really bland for something calling itself *Cyberpunk*
<|endoftext|>
Idk, the original trailer looked very Cyberpunk
<|endoftext|>
can you put a mouse mat in a washing machine?
<|endoftext|>
depends on the mouse mat
<|endoftext|>
what's it made of
<|endoftext|>
https://i.imgur.com/3ONcA1Z.jpg
<|endoftext|>
lol, i love the original too
<|endoftext|>
Pubg youtubers?
<|endoftext|>
No the comic, the artist's work is pretty popular
<|endoftext|>
I've been on tinder for at least a few hours now, why have I not got laid yet? üôÅ
<|endoftext|>
It's the crossed fingers, freaks people out on a primal level
<|endoftext|>
It shows that I am able to strangle effectively
<|endoftext|>
Bitches love that
<|endoftext|>
lol, Smal nek
<|endoftext|>
Hot
<|endoftext|>
There are some nasty gals on here. Just found a 19yo single mum who was chavvy af
<|endoftext|>
No surprises
<|endoftext|>
I was shocked
<|endoftext|>
Shocked I tell you
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney @Misery drink on Saturday? Joosh is coming
<|endoftext|>
I already said yeah?
<|endoftext|>
Saturday specifically though
<|endoftext|>
Also rod
<|endoftext|>
I'll go if Rodney doesn't, can't stand his smugness
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  You smug SoB
<|endoftext|>
He gets to be smug
<|endoftext|>
He deserves it
<|endoftext|>
You wanna do souls on Friday if we're going out Saturday?
<|endoftext|>
sure t
<|endoftext|>
Someone needs to get hold of that big rod
<|endoftext|>
three hands
<|endoftext|>
A team of people are needed to get him dressed
<|endoftext|>
It's like shoving an entire garden hose into your sock
<|endoftext|>
@Misery don't starve?
<|endoftext|>
Olivia looks weird
<|endoftext|>
Y u on tindr
<|endoftext|>
to fuck paul
<|endoftext|>
I keep finding people my age with children - are we just old now?
<|endoftext|>
No
<|endoftext|>
25% of the people in this chat have children too
<|endoftext|>
This is false
<|endoftext|>
the bots don't count as people
<|endoftext|>
botophobic
<|endoftext|>
Fuck you
<|endoftext|>
@Misery @Rodney about 5 tomorrow then?
<|endoftext|>
Whatever sure jeesh
<|endoftext|>
Trick question, the commie bastards are hiding in tunnels
<|endoftext|>
@Misery give me some opening messages?
<|endoftext|>
Did you fall from heaven? Cos you look like the Devil
<|endoftext|>
Sorry I should have specified: messages that I might actually use
<|endoftext|>
(Actual answer, read their bio and ask a question about what they've written that you can relate to)
<|endoftext|>
Last one that I messaged you
<|endoftext|>
I gotta be honest, if she has no bio and the selfie looks chosen at random then she's probs just dtf and ill leav that to you
<|endoftext|>
There's a bit there - we should make this a team effort and then when I get laid you can have the tapes üòä
<|endoftext|>
They will be actual tapes though unfortunately
<|endoftext|>
No tah, i dont' need to watch 8 minutes of you screaming and her looking epileptic
<|endoftext|>
8 mins? You're ambitious
<|endoftext|>
Then you pass her the money and an NDA
<|endoftext|>
She signs at gunpoint and off she goes
<|endoftext|>
My good deed for the day is done
<|endoftext|>
I honestly have no good ideas . Compliment her subtly or make her laugh  is how your supposed to do it irl
<|endoftext|>
Just made a comment on the fact that tinder insults you until you message someone
<|endoftext|>
It's actually quite hurtful
<|endoftext|>
To her?
<|endoftext|>
No lol, in the message screen the app will belittle you until you send a message
<|endoftext|>
Could be a smart move by tinder
<|endoftext|>
Well yeah
<|endoftext|>
You can give me a hand [insert obvious joke] tonight, maybe we can get someone to agree to a spitroast
<|endoftext|>
There's probs an app for that
<|endoftext|>
I've found a few couples on here
<|endoftext|>
We had a good time, nice couple of guys
<|endoftext|>
Really? You meeting them for brunch on sunday?
<|endoftext|>
Is that second bit a question?
<|endoftext|>
Itisnow
<|endoftext|>
Space broke again?
<|endoftext|>
noitisntthankyouverymuch
<|endoftext|>
whatgaveyouthatidea
<|endoftext|>
No reason
<|endoftext|>
In case you wanted some more great pickup lines
<|endoftext|>
If I had to rate you from 1-10, I would rate you as a 9 because I am the one that you are missing
<|endoftext|>
What if they're clearly like a 6
<|endoftext|>
I'd rate you a 5
<|endoftext|>
Thanks mate
<|endoftext|>
You too
<|endoftext|>
Here's one,  A jewish lookish italian, a fake German cyclist and a zimbabwean are on a plane
<|endoftext|>
this isnt a pickup line
<|endoftext|>
it's the start of a joke
<|endoftext|>
you end it
<|endoftext|>
this isn't how that joke format works
<|endoftext|>
Niall is the punchline
<|endoftext|>
it isn't funny though
<|endoftext|>
Are you a musician vampire? Because my organ is filling up with blood
<|endoftext|>
that one's good
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Wait how? I thought you were bartending?
<|endoftext|>
Bar-back, all the bad jobs in the bar. Most of the bartenders were on coke.
<|endoftext|>
Where were you? We should have come in for a drink
<|endoftext|>
It was like a late 20s+ sorta bar called impossible
<|endoftext|>
We'll come harass you next time

<|endoftext|>
@everyone Wanna a play an easy group game?
<|endoftext|>
far cry 5?
<|endoftext|>
Codenames!
<|endoftext|>
It's two teams. Each team gets a colour and one person to be the overseer. The overseer provides a hint each turn to his team to help his teammate figures which words to select from a colourless board.
<|endoftext|>
The game is simple but a good communication game
<|endoftext|>
I prefer fc5, I punched a pig to death yesterday
<|endoftext|>
It's the first time ive seen us all in chat
<|endoftext|>
Those were separate sentences btw
<|endoftext|>
True
<|endoftext|>
ryan could play too
<|endoftext|>
it's a minimum of 4 players
<|endoftext|>
dont punch yourself to death mate
<|endoftext|>
I'll fukcing kick you
<|endoftext|>
1min to teach people to play
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

gimme some ideas for places to go btw. I think I might be going to France at some point so I need to get 2 weeks off, probably gonna have to plan it around what other people already have booked off
<|endoftext|>
Nice, Amsterdam, Ibiza (or any Spanish island really). Ireland is probs cheapest. I'm guessing you guys don't wanna go somewhere cold and that Josch is bored of Germany.
<|endoftext|>
Crete exists too
<|endoftext|>
<https://www.kayak.co.uk/magazine/best-student-holiday-destinations-2017/>
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous thoughts?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney I also care what you think, but less than I care about what josc thinks
<|endoftext|>
That's not nice and im guessing rod won't be on until his shift ends
<|endoftext|>
When's that?
<|endoftext|>
no idea, im just guessing
<|endoftext|>
go find him for me
<|endoftext|>
Is josch up for going away?
<|endoftext|>
think os
<|endoftext|>
so
<|endoftext|>
Quake champions is free on steam rn
<|endoftext|>
idk I don;t mind going germany but you'd all make me speak german
<|endoftext|>
Anywhere hot in the Germ? What do you think of the suggestions at 104pm?
<|endoftext|>
Not sure I want to go to Ibiza
<|endoftext|>
Ok, it's just suggestion. I'm not big on the idea. My only criteria is we go somewhere people our age go
<|endoftext|>
Amsterdam is my fav thus far. Italy or greece are also options. Not big on greece tho
<|endoftext|>
Josch any criteria? Or just no Ibiza
<|endoftext|>
I'd be down for Germany, is it cheaper to train or fly? @Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
Probably fly
<|endoftext|>
Is there anywhere in Germany for people our age to have fun tho
<|endoftext|>
There are lots of camps
<|endoftext|>
Oh wait
<|endoftext|>
I imagined this as a lads holiday, where we go do crazy shit. I'll capitulate to the majority if not.
<|endoftext|>
I look far too jew-y for this
<|endoftext|>
Josch will have to protect me
<|endoftext|>
A 'lads holiday'?
<|endoftext|>
Idk
<|endoftext|>
a holiday where young people do fun shit
<|endoftext|>
like normal people do
<|endoftext|>
Sounds annoying
<|endoftext|>
what's the alternative
<|endoftext|>
We spend 3 days in a smack den
<|endoftext|>
We could go to East Dunbartonshire and beat Vincent mcfarlane within an inch of his life
<|endoftext|>
hwhaaaaatt?
<|endoftext|>
Fucking Scottish prick
<|endoftext|>
When you spend ages setting up a VM as a dirty machine and then your colleague restarts it when windows is updating and bricks it üëçüòä
<|endoftext|>
When you save a dead VM like a fucking hero üëç‚ò∫Ô∏è
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous do you have climbing gear?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
those two letters were worth every hour that I spent at my desk crying, waiting for you to respond üòç
<|endoftext|>
think you can hire it all for like ¬£6 at MCC
<|endoftext|>
if you can get rod to come on then I'll do destiny later
<|endoftext|>
destiny 2 is still a thing?
<|endoftext|>
Well it still exists
<|endoftext|>
Joschy got it on humble
<|endoftext|>
Rodney, wanna play Cunt Wars?
<|endoftext|>
The fuck is that
<|endoftext|>
It's advertised *everywhere* online
<|endoftext|>
http://cuntwars.com/
<|endoftext|>
We clearly go to different websites
<|endoftext|>
I'm not clicking that
<|endoftext|>
I chose rodney because i know he watches anime online and it's advertised on those sites alot
<|endoftext|>
I'm surprised that none of you know of it tho
<|endoftext|>
what?
<|endoftext|>
why am I blakevin
<|endoftext|>
More importantly, have you ever seen that weird game before?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
bullshit
<|endoftext|>
Exactly
<|endoftext|>
targeted advertisements
<|endoftext|>
Yup
<|endoftext|>
Cookies niall
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
You creep
<|endoftext|>
It appears as ads on anime sites all the time. Alot of people know about this game, the gamestreamers i watch make jokes about it occansionally
<|endoftext|>
i use adblock
<|endoftext|>
jesus christ nial
<|endoftext|>
Most streaming sites i use ask to disable it
<|endoftext|>
that is filth
<|endoftext|>
don't actually click it!
<|endoftext|>
Why do you want to play porn games with Rodney anyway?
<|endoftext|>
it was a joke
<|endoftext|>
my vpn has adblock
<|endoftext|>
I've explained this
<|endoftext|>
where
<|endoftext|>
7:44 PM] Yarny: I chose rodney because i know he watches anime online and it's advertised on those sites alot
<|endoftext|>
Please stop explaining it
<|endoftext|>
ahhhh
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
yaha
<|endoftext|>
You two should take this into personal chat
<|endoftext|>
that's the site i use
<|endoftext|>
thats a crime
<|endoftext|>
you shouldnt pirate nial
<|endoftext|>
Fuk crunchyroll and Hulu

You wouldn't download a handbag

It makes me very uncomfortable. As does nialls new name and his habit of trying to get us to play weird hentai games with him
<|endoftext|>
My new name's funny
<|endoftext|>
I saw an imgur guy called 'SupportYourLocalHookers' and the name came to me
<|endoftext|>
If you have to say that then it isnt
<|endoftext|>
But it is

We said those exact same lines at your place the time before the ds boardgame
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
no proof
<|endoftext|>
and you said something similar to good album aswell
<|endoftext|>
unless it was in the bedroom there's no video and therefore it didn't happen
<|endoftext|>
if it was then you can have the tape but im not editing it, you have to scrub through hours of me crying and masturbating, and rarely getting laid

would you trade an 8086 for a threadripper 1950x?
<|endoftext|>
I didn't win üò¶
<|endoftext|>
the odds are to low
<|endoftext|>
but idk, 8086 would be better for my use case but 1950x has better resale value so I could just sell it and buy an 8086
<|endoftext|>
i found my usb
<|endoftext|>
Cool haha
<|endoftext|>
i though i washed it last year
<|endoftext|>
You should wash it now

It's not a full server
<|endoftext|>
Gigabit though
<|endoftext|>
In theory I can copy to my nas at 1gbit/s from work
<|endoftext|>
Plenty enough to stream content too
<|endoftext|>
So who's first?

@Tyranulous you reckon it's safe to  reboot? been blank for about 25 mins now, was doing a driver update
<|endoftext|>
can't evn ping it, rdp is freaking out
<|endoftext|>
weirdly it isn't  timing out so it's getting some response, router reports it as working normally too
<|endoftext|>
well fuck
<|endoftext|>
looks bad
<|endoftext|>
I'm gonna call bullshit on that but seems fine now at least
<|endoftext|>
managed to do a normal reboot through powershell kinda
<|endoftext|>

I will do, on a tram currently though

<|endoftext|>
You've played?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I pirated it before
<|endoftext|>
You disgust me
<|endoftext|>
Pretty sure @Tyranulous has borderlands 2, we played 1 together. Someone stalk his steam profile and find out
<|endoftext|>
I saw he does when i bought it
<|endoftext|>
Nice
<|endoftext|>
How much you recon ds2 is?
<|endoftext|>
12
<|endoftext|>
OOh, ¬£7.50
<|endoftext|>
It's not as good as the other two
<|endoftext|>
Also sotfs is the only version worth playing
<|endoftext|>
The gameplay feels worse then ds1 but there are some cool weapons and enemy types in it. Worse bosses tho
<|endoftext|>
I prefer the way ds2 mobs look to any of the other souls games
<|endoftext|>
I guess. The hitboxes suck too
<|endoftext|>
I disagree, rolling under weapons and such was great imo
<|endoftext|>
Not really an opinion, Google it, people have the game running in Dev mode and they're all just rectangles around the weapon
<|endoftext|>
thats what hitboxes tend to be
<|endoftext|>
Usually there the size of the weapon though
<|endoftext|>
It felt decent enough, i don't remember any unfair clipping with invisible weapons
<|endoftext|>
Smelter demon or aara are good examples
<|endoftext|>
Should we ping josch for Board2?
<|endoftext|>
Still not home
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505 didn't we play bl2 for a bit a while back?
<|endoftext|>
Possibly, we played all of 1

<|endoftext|>
<https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick>
<|endoftext|>
not many runs i care about this year tbh
<|endoftext|>
iknowright
<|endoftext|>
cuphead defo thp
<|endoftext|>
yeah ill probably watch the cuphead run, for sure anything tasbot too
<|endoftext|>
Might watch castlevania (there's like 3 runs)
<|endoftext|>
Prey too (still need to play that)
<|endoftext|>
circle of the moon, none of the others for me i dont think and yeah runs of games like system shock and prey are usually cool
<|endoftext|>
oracle of seasons too, 2d zelda runs are always good
<|endoftext|>
2dzelda speedruns not my cuppa tea
<|endoftext|>
i really like them, especially the game boy ones, links awakening dx is the best zelda and the best speedgame
<|endoftext|>
i probably will watch the shadow warrior classic redux run too but i think thats it
<|endoftext|>
I'm guessing it's a good sign when someone matches with you then immediately unmatches? it means they like you right?
<|endoftext|>
Have you changed your picture yet?
<|endoftext|>
it's just a big dick
<|endoftext|>
It is, just sitting there on the couch
<|endoftext|>
Change your pic and you'll get better responses. You know this.

Nice, Amsterdam or any Spanish island really. Ireland is probs cheapest. I'm guessing you guys don't wanna go somewhere cold. Crete exists too [1:05 PM] Glass Half Chubbed: https://www.kayak.co.uk/magazine/best-student-holiday-destinations-2017/

<|endoftext|>
@Rodney thoughts? Think you're the biggest variable now, can you get the time off?

A big, thick variable

@Louie1505  Send the screenshot, you've peeked my interest
<|endoftext|>
piqued
<|endoftext|>
and no
<|endoftext|>
put it in chat, so rod can see
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
i think he has a better grasp of my tastes
<|endoftext|>
deleted it for josch too so he can't betray me
<|endoftext|>
I know exasctly what ytou like, don't lie to yourself
<|endoftext|>
i think you have like a 40-60% chance. we've never had an in depth convo on the subject.
<|endoftext|>
I only told rodney so he would tell me his
<|endoftext|>
yeah but i see the girls you go after haha, I don't need to have a conversation about it
<|endoftext|>
josch likes posh girls, I'll fuck anything because I'm a deviant, rod likes white girls, and you're into weird artsy chicks who are slightly socially awkward
<|endoftext|>
pretty close yeah.
<|endoftext|>
it's good because we don't really have much overlap so we can all be happy
<|endoftext|>
rod's one is too vague
<|endoftext|>
well yeah exactly
<|endoftext|>
he'll go for anything white
<|endoftext|>
problem solved
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney we're arranging going away in a couple of weeks, can you get holidays?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
you have to have holidays?
<|endoftext|>
like legally
<|endoftext|>
yea but i just started
<|endoftext|>
when anyways
<|endoftext|>
so? you can book them off, you should get an amount per year
<|endoftext|>
16/7-20/7
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
wait that's only 4 days? how long are we going away?
<|endoftext|>
i dont understand that date
<|endoftext|>
do you understand dates in general?
<|endoftext|>
thats not a date
<|endoftext|>
it's a range of dates
<|endoftext|>
because my holidays aren't all days after one date
<|endoftext|>
because that wouldn't make sense
<|endoftext|>
i can probably get some time off but not then cos i have a graduation on 18/7
<|endoftext|>
I already took it, we won't be doing a full week anyway
<|endoftext|>
we could do 13-18
<|endoftext|>
12 - 17 so rod has time
<|endoftext|>
well I'm working 12/13
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
sorry
<|endoftext|>
you see
<|endoftext|>
its prime day and they aint letting people off
<|endoftext|>
around that time
<|endoftext|>
that makes sense
<|endoftext|>
i got lucky with the 18th
<|endoftext|>
when is it just so i can order a load of stuff?
<|endoftext|>
also play ow rod?
<|endoftext|>
it could be the 16th
<|endoftext|>
i cant play right now. tommorow tho
<|endoftext|>
np
<|endoftext|>
@Misery south of england somewhere?
<|endoftext|>
How long we going for?
<|endoftext|>
Up to you
<|endoftext|>
I thought you put 4 days? (+2 if you have a weekend)
<|endoftext|>
Well I don't have to take weekends as holidays
<|endoftext|>
I have the whole week off
<|endoftext|>
7 days?
<|endoftext|>
I don't have to take weekends off
<|endoftext|>
I have 5 days off
<|endoftext|>
I always have weekends off
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  How long and when (no homo)
<|endoftext|>
He said he's not coming
<|endoftext|>
I only work like 2-3 days a week if they need me and Josch  is free now
<|endoftext|>
Rod pulled out?
<|endoftext|>
Really
<|endoftext|>
Rod never pulls out
<|endoftext|>
Did he?
<|endoftext|>
Yes
<|endoftext|>
fok
<|endoftext|>
This once
<|endoftext|>
so 7 daysish it is then
<|endoftext|>
Probably a bit less
<|endoftext|>
yeah, like 6day + travel
<|endoftext|>
That's still 7,I'll have to do other stuff too
<|endoftext|>
5 nights then and we can leave on the sixth night/evening?
<|endoftext|>
I was thinking go on Monday come back on Thursday or Friday
<|endoftext|>
See what josch says
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
He's eating I think
<|endoftext|>
It would be great if his speakers are on
<|endoftext|>
Tts
<|endoftext|>
Josch, my boii, where is the blow you owe me
<|endoftext|>
josch
<|endoftext|>
juice
<|endoftext|>
Lu-E how far you wanna go?
<|endoftext|>
Yorkshire coast is nice, as is South of England
<|endoftext|>
Could do Northern France
<|endoftext|>
Scotland is an option, could go to edinborough to see josch's uni
<|endoftext|>
Won't be as warm
<|endoftext|>
good
<|endoftext|>
im sweating my chubs off
<|endoftext|>
Good
<|endoftext|>
what i miss?
<|endoftext|>
Lots
<|endoftext|>
Rodney is pregnant
<|endoftext|>
josch, rodney came out
<|endoftext|>
That too
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous find somewhere for us
<|endoftext|>
I'prefer like Bristol, Dublin or a major scottish city. I'd go anywhere i guess
<|endoftext|>
bristol?
<|endoftext|>
why would anyone want to go bristol
<|endoftext|>
^^^
<|endoftext|>
Seems like a nice place. My no.1 is Dublin
<|endoftext|>
I'd do ireland
<|endoftext|>
we could also go see game of thrones set, the guiness factory and stuff
<|endoftext|>
Jos?
<|endoftext|>
I'd be cool with dublin
<|endoftext|>
Sweet, someone find flights then
<|endoftext|>
Josch, you're very good at shopping
<|endoftext|>
ferry cheaper, lll look once im done with food too
<|endoftext|>
Ferry sucks dick though
<|endoftext|>
is it though
<|endoftext|>
cheaper i mean
<|endoftext|>
That too
<|endoftext|>
¬£26 round trip on ryan air
<|endoftext|>
Wow haha, that's nothing
<|endoftext|>
ferry can be fun, it's like and hr on the ferry and 20min inout. flying's alright then
<|endoftext|>
where would you sail from
<|endoftext|>
It's also not really costal right? We'd need to get a train or something
<|endoftext|>
liverpool
<|endoftext|>
Ew Liverpool
<|endoftext|>
or that place in wales
<|endoftext|>
on the late side to book ferry anyway
<|endoftext|>
Im good with flying ttho but you can get a ferry anytime.
<|endoftext|>
Ryanair is super cheap
<|endoftext|>
monday 16th?
<|endoftext|>
cheper if you fly at 10 but you get there 11 so...
<|endoftext|>
thats ¬£35 round trip
<|endoftext|>
need hotel and a food budget
<|endoftext|>
hotel - ¬£¬£¬£
<|endoftext|>
could try and find a package
<|endoftext|>
might end up cheaper
<|endoftext|>
have a look
<|endoftext|>
could stay in a hostel
<|endoftext|>
rather get a decent hotel tbg
<|endoftext|>
might be worth it to go to an all-inclusive hotel. there's no special cuisine to go try really
<|endoftext|>
guinness

<|endoftext|>
7 person house
<|endoftext|>
seems overkill
<|endoftext|>
fair
<|endoftext|>
plus its miles from the city centre
<|endoftext|>
whats your opinion on sharing rooms?
<|endoftext|>
I'm good
<|endoftext|>
As long as you keep your pants on
<|endoftext|>
as long as you don't
<|endoftext|>
I'm also good on a sofa if it comes down to it
<|endoftext|>
I am also good with him on a sofa
<|endoftext|>
The flights are cheap but the hotels make it 220+ pp for 5 nights
<|endoftext|>
can get thomas cook for like ~250 pp
<|endoftext|>
air bnb is for the whole place so that would be /3
<|endoftext|>
no food included
<|endoftext|>
including flights
<|endoftext|>
So hotel, hostel or airbnb?
<|endoftext|>
i vote airbnb
<|endoftext|>
or hotel
<|endoftext|>
either
<|endoftext|>
i have no oppinion
<|endoftext|>
we know
<|endoftext|>
can try airbnb, problem is they will want to know our ages and as soon as they see we're 19 they'll nope the fuck out of us
<|endoftext|>
I'm 23
<|endoftext|>
ha
<|endoftext|>
you're 42
<|endoftext|>
Say it's 2 20yo and their 19yo child

<|endoftext|>
each!
<|endoftext|>
never mind
<|endoftext|>
i noticed that
<|endoftext|>
Your gonna run into a lot of Nialls
<|endoftext|>
I choose not to
<|endoftext|>
171 is not bad for a week in a hotel though really
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous that's just a room
<|endoftext|>
*i think you underestimate how much these things cost niall
<|endoftext|>
It's like 50-100 quid to feed us all oon top
<|endoftext|>
the fuck do you eat?
<|endoftext|>
I don't spend that in a month
<|endoftext|>
excluding booze
<|endoftext|>
I spend like 40-60 quid for like 10days of food
<|endoftext|>
"*excluding booze*"
<|endoftext|>
why tf are you spending so much on food?
<|endoftext|>
My way of paying rent
<|endoftext|>
wow
<|endoftext|>
i get the food
<|endoftext|>
or just move out
<|endoftext|>
holy shit, hostels are so much cheaper
<|endoftext|>
well yeah
<|endoftext|>
mixed dorm haha
<|endoftext|>
we'd be in with 7 randoms
<|endoftext|>
im fine with whatever, just make sure we have running water and wifi
<|endoftext|>
it is a hostel so yeah...
<|endoftext|>
Josch, how much total excluding food?
<|endoftext|>
you can usually book rooms in hostels
<|endoftext|>
as well
<|endoftext|>
not this one
<|endoftext|>
I don't wanna get fiddled in the night
<|endoftext|>
had to reduce number of days to even get any avalibility
<|endoftext|>
Keep looking minions, find me a good place to stay
<|endoftext|>
this shit ain't cheap
<|endoftext|>
Yeah
<|endoftext|>
fuking leave voters, depreciating our pound
<|endoftext|>
Luckily I'm very wealthy, so more of a you problem üòõ
<|endoftext|>
what are the dates again
<|endoftext|>
Week of the 16th
<|endoftext|>
how about you subsudise this trip then
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
How about you gargle my balls
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

[]  to [] ?
<|endoftext|>
Week of the 16th
<|endoftext|>
16 to []?
<|endoftext|>
21?
<|endoftext|>
Look at a fucking calendar
<|endoftext|>
How long are weeks?
<|endoftext|>
like we could leave on the saturday or sunday or monday ffs
<|endoftext|>
We also don't have to go on the Monday
<|endoftext|>
Somewhere in that week
<|endoftext|>
It's actually very simple
<|endoftext|>
leaving on monday cheaper
<|endoftext|>
and weekends are harder to find accomodation for
<|endoftext|>
its all a compromise
<|endoftext|>
True
<|endoftext|>
flights are easier to fit around accomdation
<|endoftext|>
i can go whenever, just have a week notice
<|endoftext|>
i wanna go sooner the the 16th tbh

i was serious about using joc's status and my irish name
<|endoftext|>
you shouldn't have been
<|endoftext|>
it makes sense
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
it does. Who would you trust more, an foreigner or someone from your country. And oxford makes us seem posha nd no chavs who'd reck the place
<|endoftext|>
ok so you're a racist for a start
<|endoftext|>
it's common sense. That's not racism it's prejudice and a bit of biggotry. Most people have it. Nobodys a saint.

@Rodney get kf2 bb, maybe cheaper on g2a or something
<|endoftext|>
how long to download big boy?
<|endoftext|>
jos will play with us
<|endoftext|>
lel
<|endoftext|>
10 hours
<|endoftext|>
wow
<|endoftext|>
genuinely would be faster to bring your pc here, download it, and take your pc back
<|endoftext|>
yea
<|endoftext|>
you should buy you parent better internet now that you're rich
<|endoftext|>
ill be gone in 2 months
<|endoftext|>
don't do it rodie, you have too much to live for
<|endoftext|>
this game integrates wioth my keyboard somehow, so the lights strobe when the rounds about to start and do a thing when i run out of ammo
<|endoftext|>
it's weird
<|endoftext|>
smashed it
<|endoftext|>
wait for me
<|endoftext|>
eh?
<|endoftext|>
:neil:
<|endoftext|>
8 more hours to go
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
still be faster to come here and patch in haha
<|endoftext|>
we should get those ubiquiti dishes so you can use my internet from there
<|endoftext|>
@everyone anyone know how to enable patching on a router level? Don't like that you can just plug in without a key, should default you to the guest network
<|endoftext|>
actually nm, think I can do it with my switch
<|endoftext|>
why would this be a requirement
<|endoftext|>
that's a good question
<|endoftext|>
another good question: where tf can I put a 24 port rack switch?
<|endoftext|>
you need a server rack
<|endoftext|>
ikr
<|endoftext|>
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/10-4U-450mm-Black-Wall-Cabinet-Network-Data-Rack-SOHO-Home-Office-Server-Switch/352135735246?hash=item51fcece7ce:g:-BYAAOSw8GtZS-wp
<|endoftext|>
only a 4u for 44 still
<|endoftext|>
wouldn't be good for future expansion
<|endoftext|>
exactly, I would eventually want to have a proper server running VMs and acting as my router etc
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
looks like a shit oven
<|endoftext|>
Do you think people would care if I stole an empty wall mount one from that school? It's currently mounted about 10 feet in the air
<|endoftext|>
oooh, then I could have my microserver as a domain controller and move my NAS to a VM on a proper server I could build with my xeons, then have all the VMs because i'd have 16 cores to split out

jeff bezos
<|endoftext|>
ffs
<|endoftext|>
reckon I can run a 24prt gig switch fanless?
<|endoftext|>
only one way to find out
<|endoftext|>
hmm :/
<|endoftext|>
it doesn't have poe so it's all processing heat and not transformers]
<|endoftext|>
just dont process any thing and you'll be fine
<|endoftext|>
it's a switch, that would defeat the point
<|endoftext|>
it would turn into a 1 to 23 ethernet splitter
<|endoftext|>
how the fuck do I not have a single power brick
<|endoftext|>
stop stealing my shit Rodie
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous I'm going into sale, can you think of anything we/I might need for going away
<|endoftext|>
Forward what to me?
<|endoftext|>
email/whatsapp
<|endoftext|>
Ta. I don't think ill need bag check in, im fine to carry mine for most of the day
<|endoftext|>
we can check in at 2 anyway
<|endoftext|>
arriving at 9, probably about 4 hrs when we get out etc, we can just go get alcohols

<|endoftext|>
because I can't understand it
<|endoftext|>
wtf
<|endoftext|>
why
<|endoftext|>
i mean i know why but fucking why
<|endoftext|>
Honestly don't know what the problem is
<|endoftext|>
the filename has a dot in it so it's taking that as the extension before i concat the .zip on the end and file extensions have a set length so it's trimming off my file name
<|endoftext|>
nice one rod
<|endoftext|>
doesn't fix it to concat the .zip before the copy op, apparently it thinks "07.2018_20-23-21.zip" is my entire file extension
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous fix my code please
<|endoftext|>
I give up
<|endoftext|>
you do it
<|endoftext|>
I'll pay
<|endoftext|>
Ha, I don't need you josch, I fixed it myself and now you have to pay me
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Alrighty. What's the name of the bar you're at now btw?
<|endoftext|>
impossible, it's for like 30 yos
<|endoftext|>
looks fancy#
<|endoftext|>
yeah, shots are ¬£4.50
<|endoftext|>
and do they treat you well or is it like amazon?
<|endoftext|>
I'm in a 35'C small back room cleaning half the time, it's soooo hot
<|endoftext|>
I do get offered drugs occasionally
<|endoftext|>
yeah it sounds pretty fucking hot üòâ
<|endoftext|>
what drugs? where? from whom?
<|endoftext|>
drugs?
<|endoftext|>
i sometimes get groped too
<|endoftext|>
this place sounds awesome
<|endoftext|>
I told ya, the bartenders are on coke
<|endoftext|>
ok I'm quitting to work there
<|endoftext|>
I'll give up a promising dev career for drugs and sexual harassment, it'll be great
<|endoftext|>
I spend like an hour each day doing bins, it's not glamorous
<|endoftext|>
free drinks?
<|endoftext|>
soft until closing
<|endoftext|>
no i mean for friends
<|endoftext|>
and acquaintances
<|endoftext|>
don't know, assume  not but maybe.
<|endoftext|>
i guess the bigger question is can they physically stop you
<|endoftext|>
they've had to really crack down on the finances as people kept stealing from the tils
<|endoftext|>
so there's free money going too?
<|endoftext|>
not anymore aparently
<|endoftext|>
closer, still missing a p
<|endoftext|>
meh
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
No responce, we dry

<|endoftext|>
I actually had a kinda good conversation with that girl too üò¶
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
they are not even worth stealing
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
it's for the server
<|endoftext|>
need back up space
<|endoftext|>
surely sever would want to have nas drives
<|endoftext|>
only for hot data
<|endoftext|>
10tb helium drives
<|endoftext|>
how much space is on your server?
<|endoftext|>
1tb currently, plenty for me for now, just need to be able to have multiple backups of that
<|endoftext|>
currently even with a zip and windows compression i get like 5% off
<|endoftext|>
just the type of file, it won't do much with media
<|endoftext|>
store it on tape
<|endoftext|>
why are the writers so expensive
<|endoftext|>
also loading a tape is a lot more work than writing some code to run overnight
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous @Rodney wanna try that thing as a 3? we might actually win
<|endoftext|>
sure
<|endoftext|>
ye
<|endoftext|>
give me 5

@Tyranulous  [2:39 PM] Empathy: Idk, it's like im taking a taxi to your place to take another taxi.  Maybe josch could order the transport to his house then pick me up near stretford tram then pick you up on the main road in sale before going to airport NEW MESSAGES
<|endoftext|>
You wanna do that?
<|endoftext|>

Also, can i exchange pounds in the airport?
<|endoftext|>
just draw out a load when you get there. You'll get charged but if you just draw out like 200 at once it won't be much
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I get paid in cash at the bar

What do you think is going to replace it? I reckon it's going to be the year of the esports match3
<|endoftext|>
in a year or two it's gonna get stale, then either a decent cheap fps mmorpg is gonna come out or just go back to normal matchmaking arena shooters (maybe CS will bring out a new game)

That's what your council tax is for. Lu, you must have like a bin 4x the size of a normal bin on the property for the tenants.
<|endoftext|>
Don't pay council tax bby
<|endoftext|>
but your landlord does
<|endoftext|>
Sucks to be them
<|endoftext|>
We just have a load of normal sized bins
<|endoftext|>
Woah, you can rent servers in azure for like ¬£9 a month

Oh, and i ran into people from college at mcd's, they said they saw Cole and Mitch in the birdcage.
<|endoftext|>
(Dunkey was on yesterdays h3h3 podcast)
<|endoftext|>
Why can't we know her name?
<|endoftext|>
And address?
<|endoftext|>
I also didn't see her or can't remember :(
<|endoftext|>
Cole and Mitchell went to the birdcage
<|endoftext|>
I saw that the first time?
<|endoftext|>
no comment?
<|endoftext|>
No?
<|endoftext|>
Are you asking to go?
<|endoftext|>
no, i thought you'd find it funny
<|endoftext|>
Why?
<|endoftext|>
it just seems like a funny image of them being smashed around boydancers and cabaret
<|endoftext|>
This is true. You should hit them up on fb, see if they want to come tonight
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
speaking of hot things, how's it going with the H-Bomb?
<|endoftext|>
Has @Tyranulous run away back to Germany?
<|endoftext|>
Northern Ireland actually
<|endoftext|>
Good riddance
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney new error bubbles and stuff are done, left you some samples
<|endoftext|>
atm3.shapethecube.net
<|endoftext|>
got a spare mobo, cpu and PS
<|endoftext|>
"The Discord Overlay now has Text Chat! Continue chatting in servers and DMs without an alt-tab."
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney what they is?
<|endoftext|>
I actually found a board
<|endoftext|>
a320m-dgs with ryzen 1400 and 350w ps
<|endoftext|>
Could you look up ryzen 1400 vs xeon x5570 please? I'll get hit if I do it at work
<|endoftext|>
1400 21% faster
<|endoftext|>
cooler too
<|endoftext|>
Ffs
<|endoftext|>
How much you want? I'd have to buy memory
<|endoftext|>
And a case
<|endoftext|>
60%?
<|endoftext|>
i dont have the original package box
<|endoftext|>
What's that?
<|endoftext|>
63?
<|endoftext|>
for cpu
<|endoftext|>
30 for mobo
<|endoftext|>
idk, would work out way cheaper to just build around my xeon, but also 20% perf boost and ddr4 ram is nice
<|endoftext|>
DDR4 is so expensive ffs
<|endoftext|>
yea
<|endoftext|>
@Misery you ever find out what that other pc is?
<|endoftext|>
I could also just get this https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Dell-Precision-T3500-Workstation-LGA1366-Socket-PCI-E-Motherboard-09KPNV-9KPNV/392085928225?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D53471%26meid%3Ddd373b86630446309bf290d1aba846f2%26pid%3D100675%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D15%26sd%3D401374895891%26itm%3D392085928225&_trksid=p2481888.c100675.m4236&_trkparms=pageci%3A73a712de-9bc2-11e8-8d7c-74dbd18005e3%7Cparentrq%3A1e51ec3f1650add917334265fffc97db%7Ciid%3A1
<|endoftext|>
you don't have any memory for it too do you?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
I think you should buy some and sell it to me at a 90% loss to yourself
<|endoftext|>
good idea
<|endoftext|>
Thanks
<|endoftext|>
I have lots
<|endoftext|>
Spot the issue
<|endoftext|>
no clue
<|endoftext|>
Look at top 2 lines
<|endoftext|>
@Misery just got in, what's happening tonight?
<|endoftext|>
Anything. I just need to eat and get ready. What time you thinking?
<|endoftext|>
Whenever really, I'm free from now
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Go for a drink before?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
otherwise I would do J'Zargo
<|endoftext|>
we would all do J'Zargo
<|endoftext|>
Just listening to a GOT later seasons discussion, just heard "It's like there's an unfinished leonardno da vinci painting in the hands of a ninth grade art student who tries to complete it"
<|endoftext|>
Sounds about right
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
He's weird
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney we forgot to invite you
<|endoftext|>
You missed the best thing ever
<|endoftext|>
I'll telly iu tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
Some emo bitch told nrll to kill himself
<|endoftext|>
Was great
<|endoftext|>
wut?
<|endoftext|>
Tell you when I see you
<|endoftext|>
Going out this weekend?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
Oh
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
Some drunk girl said she was gonna kill herself in a month after grinding on me
<|endoftext|>
It was a surprising night
<|endoftext|>
Apparently they were unrelated things, I'm not convinced
<|endoftext|>
Rodney, there were so many girls at factory-thursday. It was intimidating
<|endoftext|>
This is true, there were many
<|endoftext|>
did you get hit when you got in Nrll?
<|endoftext|>
No, i got a quite slagging off by each parent separately. I got lucky
<|endoftext|>
Should've just crashed with me
<|endoftext|>
not with me
<|endoftext|>
at mine
<|endoftext|>
I swear that's what I meant
<|endoftext|>
oh, and i had a terrible head-ache. Never buy sambuca again, i had too many spirits last night, mixing that with the whiskey before was bad for me
<|endoftext|>
It was tequila
<|endoftext|>
but yeah mixing drinks will do that
<|endoftext|>
Going out tomorrow?
<|endoftext|>
sure
<|endoftext|>
sweet
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney you should come
<|endoftext|>
Oh I forgot to say, when we got split up at some point, I was talking to a girl and I asked her if she'd seen a man with stupid hair and gestured to my forehead and she knew exactly who I meant and pointed you out üòÉ
<|endoftext|>
was great
<|endoftext|>
She also told me I looked very sad
<|endoftext|>
when you were not in one of the rooms, for some reason you pulled some massive frowns
<|endoftext|>
That's just my face
<|endoftext|>
i dont like your conversation
<|endoftext|>
wtf
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
confused
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Explain
<|endoftext|>
Break it down
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Fine, i don't like your face
<|endoftext|>
i dont like your suicide inducing grindings
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
he does it to us all rod
<|endoftext|>
just let it happen
<|endoftext|>
she like drunk dance grind me then later grabbed my face and said she'll kill herself next month
<|endoftext|>
It's the second time in like a month ive been told a stranger in a club is gonna kill themselves
<|endoftext|>
rod, you coming out tomorrow? It's probs gonna be full of girls, we're going to a smiths night
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
i showed you yesterday
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
:NaziGold:
<|endoftext|>
What is that?
<|endoftext|>
hover over it
<|endoftext|>
ffs
<|endoftext|>
it's for josch
<|endoftext|>
whenever he does something upper class
<|endoftext|>
lu-e how's your hang over?
<|endoftext|>
fine haha, I was in work at 10
<|endoftext|>
I think you're underestimating my liver's ability to process toxins üòÉ
<|endoftext|>
Think I've decided the new server shall be called Aela because she's not a useless bullshit follower like Lydia and can actually do some damage üòÉ
<|endoftext|>
Rodney, put some pants on
<|endoftext|>
no don't
<|endoftext|>
send pics though
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  You free tonight?
<|endoftext|>
or you just gonna suck some ass
<|endoftext|>
im not free tonight my man
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
oh, who's ass then?
<|endoftext|>
he just doesn't like us
<|endoftext|>
I feel like he loses admins if he hates us in real life, we can just replace him with Jan to meet our diversity quota
<|endoftext|>
I disagree with the choice of Jan. He's the opposite of rodney and can thro things into chaos. We should interview some possible diversity hires instead, see if we get a better deal. I'll put an add on Craigslist.
<|endoftext|>
We need a more mellow hire
<|endoftext|>
what!!?
<|endoftext|>
You raise a good point
<|endoftext|>
stfu old rodney
<|endoftext|>
literally nothing useful wtf
<|endoftext|>
whoa
<|endoftext|>
maybe a step too far
<|endoftext|>
ikr, What has the world come to
<|endoftext|>
delete it before rod comes back
<|endoftext|>
he'll really hate you then
<|endoftext|>
we'll face a law suit
<|endoftext|>
He does anyway
<|endoftext|>
who cares
<|endoftext|>
he can sue
<|endoftext|>
I'm exempt from legal action
<|endoftext|>
after what happened in 2009
<|endoftext|>
when is @Tyranulous back? He knows where to find loads of minorities

she like broke bones if i remember right
<|endoftext|>
Just about ready, can leave whenever
<|endoftext|>
look at Rodie playing ow and posting YouTube videos, looks how busy he is
<|endoftext|>
I say we take away his admin rights
<|endoftext|>
for being a naughty boy
<|endoftext|>
Rodney. @Rodney  Rodney, you lied to me
<|endoftext|>
i was busy. but clubing is even worse
<|endoftext|>
*5:53 PM] Spam Bot: im not free tonight my man*
<|endoftext|>
It takes a few times, i didn't like it until i got girls to dance with me. Rodney, you better not be a whore this time next year
<|endoftext|>
He loses admin, nothing I can do, sorry Rodie
<|endoftext|>
fuk
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney this is where you live now
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
Enjoy the high quality ballsack
<|endoftext|>
That's what I say every time right before sex
<|endoftext|>
you have to highlight the positives to distract them from the negative
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, don't look at my tearing skybox
<|endoftext|>
or my micro-penis
<|endoftext|>
anyway, talk to eccles or ryan, rod. We don't chat in here where the peasants can see
<|endoftext|>
Hello fellow admin
<|endoftext|>
It's cold without him here
<|endoftext|>
good
<|endoftext|>
Josch doesn't even use discord, our voices are starting to echo
<|endoftext|>
We needed rodney as a sort of..... sounding rod, for our stupidity
<|endoftext|>
you want another ethnic is what you're saying
<|endoftext|>
because you think he's a pet
<|endoftext|>
Niall, a black is for life, not just for Christmas
<|endoftext|>
which I think is one of the worst things I've ever said
<|endoftext|>
and I'm truly sorry
<|endoftext|>
better to add errors by having one method and passing it a type and switching on it or having several methods which have a hard coded type? ie:  errors.showRule("Error Message","Error") errors.showRule("Warning Message","Warning")  or  errors.showError("Error Message") errors.showWarning("Warning Message")
<|endoftext|>
feelsbad
<|endoftext|>
Add rodney back
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney It feels empty without you
<|endoftext|>
He can come back when he goes out with us
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
You filled the void in our empty bleak hearts with your slow, sage wisdom and cheeky smile => :unknown:
<|endoftext|>
he filled my void with something black
<|endoftext|>
wow
<|endoftext|>
:jan:
<|endoftext|>
what are you, the daily mail
<|endoftext|>
no context or anything
<|endoftext|>
Yep
<|endoftext|>
Better?
<|endoftext|>
admins is a sacred place
<|endoftext|>
what happens in admins should stay in admins
<|endoftext|>
I don't post your weird comments about the jews
<|endoftext|>
dick
<|endoftext|>
Hmm searching for "jew" doesn't reflect well on you, I wouldn't tempt me
<|endoftext|>
it reflects fine on me, just me talking about how jew-y i am
<|endoftext|>
I am very jew-y
<|endoftext|>
is you back then jos?
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
fight fight fight
<|endoftext|>
we all know he'd win
<|endoftext|>
:NaziGold:  and   :giles:
<|endoftext|>
No.
<|endoftext|>
good
<|endoftext|>
Don't come back
<|endoftext|>
Also when are you back? We miss you
<|endoftext|>
Sat
<|endoftext|>
Needed you last night, niall was hanging out with his new gf so I got to stand alone and cry
<|endoftext|>
Niall had a girlfriend? Also When's rod back in this chat
<|endoftext|>
He's kinda seeing a girl I guess
<|endoftext|>
When he comes out with us
<|endoftext|>
@Misery tell him stuff
<|endoftext|>
Make it graphic
<|endoftext|>
i met a girl last friday, danced for a while and walked with her  and her friends to get a taxi. The conversation was good, we have things in common and i made her laugh. We texted a bit during the week,e.g.  she recumended some music, i commented on the video, she loved it too and we had like a discussion about it that went we cause it was like a 3d conversion, brownie points for me
<|endoftext|>
Louie and me went 42s on sat and she was there. we talked a little, her ex girlfriend was there and got upset so i only danced with her towards the tail end of the night. Lu-E's night was ruined cos of it and my hair was ruined by the rain
<|endoftext|>
So far we are unsure if she has a penis
<|endoftext|>
i didn't feel anything hitting my leg
<|endoftext|>
nice
<|endoftext|>
Josch probs wont read any of that
<|endoftext|>
true
<|endoftext|>
so do you want a ring for this week then? I have an engagement ring you can borrow
<|endoftext|>
you don't need to know why I have it
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
good deal
<|endoftext|>
new server is a fucking beast
<|endoftext|>
should i try and launch the  mc server
<|endoftext|>
I'll have to set you up an account, I'll call you in 5 mins with new details
<|endoftext|>
upgraded to 24gb though
<|endoftext|>
Just so i know, after i launch the mc server, if i desconnect, does the mc server stop?
<|endoftext|>
not if you disconnect, if you log out yes
<|endoftext|>
also it's a new server mate, you're going to have to install again
<|endoftext|>
this one's super fast though
<|endoftext|>
ok, is the port forwarding stuff the same?
<|endoftext|>
that's router side so already done
<|endoftext|>
that hasn't changed
<|endoftext|>
just checkin
<|endoftext|>
aye
<|endoftext|>
I'm a professional
<|endoftext|>
not sure why that pic sucks so much
<|endoftext|>
Whole network has gone down, unsure why, might have to fix tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
Rebooting everything now
<|endoftext|>
192.168.1.121
<|endoftext|>
the server is running but i can't find it on my server list
<|endoftext|>
you might need to port forward again or something with the new ip

Niall properly squared up to some guy for talking to hannah, was brilliant
<|endoftext|>
Guy didn't even do anything
<|endoftext|>
Really funny though
<|endoftext|>
i didn't, hannah rejected his weird approach so i tapped him on the shoulder as i stepped next to her, he seemed to understand so he safed me then hit on her friend
<|endoftext|>
He literally said to both of them 'are you on the pull'
<|endoftext|>
rod, you should use that line
<|endoftext|>
good morning rodua
<|endoftext|>
Are you on the pull?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
@Misery what time are you going?

Loreto is Happy Alleluia!  Easter creeps up on us subtly.  Lent is subdued and reflective, yet when Easter does arrive there is drama, excitement, mystery and deep joy.  The emotions and ideas which surround the celebration of the resurrection of Christ leave us bewildered: suffering, healing, pain and reconciliation are all part of the fabric of the cross and the empty tomb.  We are told that suffering brings transformation.  But central to the Easter message is the need to trust totally in the God who is never far away.  We are called each day to take a leap of faith as we go about our lives.  We are invited to listen to God and to follow His instructions if we are to reach the life which He has promised us.  God's instructions to us come in various ways and as we prepare to celebrate Easter we reflect not only on our own vulnerability but also God's humility as He accepted the weakness of suffering and brokenness.  In this picure, 'The Pool of Bethesda' by Sharon Burgmayer we see broken things but in their very brokenness they are supporting other things: If you look closely you will see broken trees, wilting flowers and a lonely human being.  But if you look even more closely you will see that the broken branch is supporting turtles and the broken iris flower on the left of the picture is holding up a little frog.  When we look at the lonely figure, sitting on a broken piece of wood, our eyes are drawn towards the intensity of the sphere light and the pool of water.
<|endoftext|>
If the message of Easter means anything to us it is that when we are weak ourselves we can often be strong for others.  The broken things in the picture provide safety and security for other vulnerable and fragile things.  And when we become aware of this we find within ourselves a strength which we never knew existed.  Sometimes we hardly notice it but Easter allows us to turn to the crucified and risen Christ and to know that life will never be the same again.  And what is the overwhelming feeling?  Of course it is joy.  In recent weeks Easter came early to the college.  The joy of the risen Lord was evident in every part of the college and rippled through staff and students.  It did not involve an empty tomb, it did not even stretch the imagination.  But it was infectious, simple and in its own way, glorious.  The idea of using dance to celebrate joy was embraced by all parts of the college and produced an extraordinary response.  The video made against the background of the song 'Happy' was a huge success.  The vitality, the energy and the engagement of the whole college community, those who took part and those who watched them, shared a joy that gave us a real understanding of the Easter story.  Easter is about life and we find life when we look for it.  When this happens we all want to dance.  Christ is Risen Alleluia!

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
well fuck
<|endoftext|>
gone bust?
<|endoftext|>
almost i believe, they shut down before they were completely fucked, they have 25 people still employed to deal with the beurocracy
<|endoftext|>
No refunds thus far for people who have prepaid for the games
<|endoftext|>
https://twitter.com/telltalegames/status/1043252010999410689
<|endoftext|>
I guess serves them right for preordering shit like a cuck but still, I was looking forward to WAU2
<|endoftext|>
I just remembered
<|endoftext|>
when you bought one game didnt the rest in the series come with it?
<|endoftext|>
episodic release
<|endoftext|>
you could buy one episode or the whole season, but we're not mid-season for anything right now
<|endoftext|>
like you could buy the full game or one at a time
<|endoftext|>
oh ok
<|endoftext|>
that sucks even worse
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
they incentivised 'preorders' so they probs got a shit tone of customers to do it
<|endoftext|>
probs have loads of money for work that didn't happen
<|endoftext|>
don't think you could buy anything that they haven't made yet, you could only ever buy one season at a time
<|endoftext|>
afaik anyway
<|endoftext|>

@Louie1505  Was out at halloween 42s thing and hannah was there again

If I were her I would be really concerned
<|endoftext|>
You go alone? Truly embraced the creep?
<|endoftext|>
nah went with one of the guys who had a girlfriend, they broke up so he was up for it
<|endoftext|>
he got really drunk as usual. he hit on one of the friends of the girl i was with and it turns out he'd already done the same with the other friend another night, nearly ruined shit
<|endoftext|>
guessing they're both dead now?
<|endoftext|>
hwhat?
<|endoftext|>
he didn't deny it
<|endoftext|>
how does one write a CV
<|endoftext|>
Mine is Experience > Qualifications > Skills. It's an ok cv, written mainly so the reader can just skim it
<|endoftext|>
do your skills include breaking and entering, and remaining undetected in a closet?
<|endoftext|>
Nof
<|endoftext|>
so you're not even good at it?
<|endoftext|>
I think that due to english syntax that rodney's name implies that he is a sausage meant to fuck instead of a fucking sasuage cos of where meaty is placed in the sentance
<|endoftext|>
disagreed, the adjective should be before the adverb
<|endoftext|>
there is no adverb
<|endoftext|>
just an adjective, a verb/curse and a noun
<|endoftext|>
depends on usage
<|endoftext|>
'I am fucking' is using it as a verb
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
and
<|endoftext|>
I've actually changed my mind, meaty fucking(v) sausage is funnier

New idea: Chrome companion extension, like the Word paper clip except he just watches what you search for and judges you
<|endoftext|>
3.99 dlc and he'll make snarky comments too
<|endoftext|>
actually super easy to do, could spit that out in an hour

<|endoftext|>
if you sub to my patreon then so will I

gifed
<|endoftext|>

?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Any ideas for a chrome companion that can rival Clippy
<|endoftext|>
Louie PG
<|endoftext|>
we should make it rodney's face
<|endoftext|>
nah, too niche
<|endoftext|>
only cougars would subscribe
<|endoftext|>
i want his idle animation to be him smoking either bubbles, tobacco or a bong depending on the version
<|endoftext|>
oh and @Louie1505  wilem defoe has a bigger dick than fassBENDER

<|endoftext|>
We'd miss our cello player if we did
<|endoftext|>
Yes cello combined with ü•Å works well
<|endoftext|>
Don't tlsp have a full string section?
<|endoftext|>
yeah, so do some others, like arcade fire, but we don't have a full string friend group
<|endoftext|>
i bagsie the harp
<|endoftext|>
we'll have to force rod to play the violin
<|endoftext|>
I can't even play anything
<|endoftext|>
you can play me like a flute if you want
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
The harp is not part of a normal string group
<|endoftext|>
Pinned a message.

<|endoftext|>
I'm sorry but it's cognitive dissonance, the stormcloaks wanted independence so they could be bigots
<|endoftext|>
thats a weird sentence
<|endoftext|>
there is no dissonance in their beliefs
<|endoftext|>
they wanted independence so they could enforce their own laws, some of which are xenophobic to outsiders
<|endoftext|>
there is no contradiction or hypocrisy
<|endoftext|>
https://giphy.com/gifs/DbyGL4qbhe8JW
<|endoftext|>
Cognitive dissonance means doing the right things for the wrong reason, they were fighting to not be a colony, but because they wanted to enforce their 'nord customs' which is mostly just racism
<|endoftext|>
that is not what cognitive dissonance means
<|endoftext|>
*a tendency for individuals to seek consistency among their cognitions (i.e., beliefs, opinions). When there is an inconsistency between attitudes or behaviors (dissonance), something must change to eliminate the dissonance.*
<|endoftext|>
there is no dissonance in their beliefs
<|endoftext|>
So it does. What do I mean then? There's a word for it
<|endoftext|>
brexit?
<|endoftext|>
No, that means brexit
<|endoftext|>
Kick the dirty elves out
<|endoftext|>
what do you think of apex legends
<|endoftext|>
Looks very titanfall, which is a good thing

<|endoftext|>
You're a premium nexus
<|endoftext|>
But yes I agree
<|endoftext|>
I haven't paid for it
<|endoftext|>
Premium
<|endoftext|>
also which version of Forgotten Magic Redone - Ordinator Compatibility Patch do i want to get?
<|endoftext|>
Unsure
<|endoftext|>
Top one I think
<|endoftext|>
josch sux
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous how close are you to having it working?
<|endoftext|>
took us a while
<|endoftext|>
at least 12 mods still to download, not happening today probably
<|endoftext|>
wanna play apex?
<|endoftext|>
can't, got to do stuff at 8
<|endoftext|>
ok bb
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney who do you think 'stuff' is?
<|endoftext|>
himself
<|endoftext|>
do i need a bethesda account for mods to work?
<|endoftext|>
Nope
<|endoftext|>
err what?
<|endoftext|>
you did?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
i dont row on a canal
<|endoftext|>
Niall set that ages ago
<|endoftext|>
all the topics are weird
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
It paid off in the end
<|endoftext|>
fuck you jos you homeless killer you
<|endoftext|>
putting these here for joschy because in my head he's coming
<|endoftext|>
see you there, princess ‚ù§
<|endoftext|>
I hope you're found guilty
<|endoftext|>
@everyone Need to sort what we're doing over summer soon, I gotta book the time
<|endoftext|>
sure, i was thinking similar
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous  What dates you out of the prison of your own making?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  I hate your attitude
<|endoftext|>
lu, any ideas?
<|endoftext|>
I think someone should invent a waterslide but with gravy
<|endoftext|>
Destination, criteria, price range, length of trip, hotel or air b&b, all inclusive?
<|endoftext|>
we going somewhere beachy?
<|endoftext|>
think rod and jos wanted to, and all inclusive will probably be cheaper
<|endoftext|>
I want somewhere with a gym in the hotel
<|endoftext|>
as few jews as possible would be good
<|endoftext|>
looking to meet like-minded spanish individuals for a hot gym sesh in your area
<|endoftext|>
absolutely not
<|endoftext|>
greek, maybe
<|endoftext|>
are you thinking all inclusive for food or booze
<|endoftext|>
meant the hotel and slights
<|endoftext|>
flights
<|endoftext|>
ok
<|endoftext|>
we thinking Spain?
<|endoftext|>
I wasn't, they're all poor
<|endoftext|>
where the hell were you thinking then?
<|endoftext|>
there are many other places which are not spain
<|endoftext|>
most places are, in fact, not spain
<|endoftext|>
but not for a YA beach holiday
<|endoftext|>
YA?
<|endoftext|>
young adult
<|endoftext|>
you still reckon you're young?
<|endoftext|>
life expectancy for us is 80+ish for us so ive got 8ish months left
<|endoftext|>
I can guarantee right now that I won't live past 27
<|endoftext|>
link some placed in spain then if you love it so much
<|endoftext|>
places
<|endoftext|>
i dont love spain
<|endoftext|>
neither do the spanish
<|endoftext|>
nowhere else is as easy tho
<|endoftext|>
where do you want to go
<|endoftext|>
I want to get a spinning chair, overdose on LSD, and see where I end up
<|endoftext|>
ffs louie
<|endoftext|>
give some fucking ideas
<|endoftext|>
a horse but with wheels for feet
<|endoftext|>
where else would you go as an alternative to spain
<|endoftext|>
I feel like we're kinda ignoring my great ideas
<|endoftext|>
Greece is fairly cheap
<|endoftext|>
ok
<|endoftext|>
any other alternatives?
<|endoftext|>
or is spain and greece the search range
<|endoftext|>
most of southern europe is good
<|endoftext|>
I'd go back to Italy
<|endoftext|>
cba with Naples tbh bc then I'd have to see family
<|endoftext|>
italy isnt very beach resorty tho
<|endoftext|>
some places defo are. I'll have a proper look when i'm home, I'm half working for a bit
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous  are you gonna speak?
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous legally you can remain silent
<|endoftext|>
speak coward, you're only killing a man
<|endoftext|>
I think we might own a house in Naples you know
<|endoftext|>
haven't been in about 10 years but I seem to recall
<|endoftext|>
also, a horse with wheels would be faster and therefore better than a normal horse
<|endoftext|>
all you dreamt it would be?
<|endoftext|>
it looks so fast
<|endoftext|>
we could motorise them, have it carry an engine
<|endoftext|>
reckon we could joust them?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney where we going?
<|endoftext|>
no clue
<|endoftext|>
not helpful
<|endoftext|>
bitch
<|endoftext|>
suck my ass
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
you fucking tell him
<|endoftext|>
suck his ass bitch
<|endoftext|>
moving on...
<|endoftext|>
Ibiza or Zante are my suggestions. Or somewhere else similar
<|endoftext|>
want the all inclusive to be max 600, dont know if that's reasonable or not
<|endoftext|>
i can do any time
<|endoftext|>
preferable make it 2 weeks
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Destination, criteria, price range, length of trip, hotel or air b&b, all inclusive?
<|endoftext|>
wait don't move on
<|endoftext|>
let me suck his ass
<|endoftext|>
I can't do 2 weeks
<|endoftext|>
10 days?
<|endoftext|>
maybe, I was thinking a week
<|endoftext|>
if im spending a bunch i wanna make it more than 7 days
<|endoftext|>
I have 2 full time jobs mate
<|endoftext|>
if I do 2 weeks then I'm fucked when I'm back
<|endoftext|>
the price scales proportionately inverse after the first week. so days like 8+ cost less then the first 7 individually
<|endoftext|>
what second job?
<|endoftext|>
you doing Lyft now?
<|endoftext|>
blowing truckers
<|endoftext|>
I do dev and DBA/network, have for ages
<|endoftext|>
hopefully be senior dev soon but
<|endoftext|>
so one full time job with semi-different roles. I thought you meant you worked 70-80hr weeks . ffs
<|endoftext|>
I do 2 jobs that people do full time, and do as much as any of them in both
<|endoftext|>
I work flexi
<|endoftext|>
so as many hours as I want kinda
<|endoftext|>
currently still working
<|endoftext|>
you should get like 18-28 days off anually
<|endoftext|>
you can afford 10+ with a weekend there too
<|endoftext|>
oh I have the holidays, I'd just be shooting myself in the foot with the amount that would build up while I was off
<|endoftext|>
we'll see how good that slave girl is I guess, maybe I can delegate
<|endoftext|>
you can fit a weekend or two in if want so you only miss like 7 or 8 days but you'll feel like shit in work the next day
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney when you free?
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous  When you free you insufferable ice cold ingrate?
<|endoftext|>
late summer
<|endoftext|>
ish
<|endoftext|>
nah  I'm indestructible. Like July rod?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
i need to get more info about my program
<|endoftext|>

He was never broken
<|endoftext|>
well...
<|endoftext|>
broken in that way
<|endoftext|>
if he ever brakes anything we gotta shoot him round back of a barn
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous You want to go on holiday
<|endoftext|>
you can pay for the rikshaw this time
<|endoftext|>
pretty sure that's a no
<|endoftext|>
didn't he say yes ages ago tho?
<|endoftext|>
josch just say no if its no. we cant possibly hate you any more than we already do for drowning that homeless man
<|endoftext|>
welcome to nialls consent corner where he argues about whether people consent to things
<|endoftext|>
it's a weekly show
<|endoftext|>
or it should be
<|endoftext|>
hourly
<|endoftext|>
"Remember kids, what does 'no' mean?"  *Crowd of children answering* "Maybe!"
<|endoftext|>
"Hi, welcome back to Consent Corner. I'm your host [name goes here]. Todays challenger is [name goes here], [18-30] and is probably from Manchester. Now, what's a challenger without a challenge. Spin the wheel!"
<|endoftext|>
*giant ass wheel spins*
<|endoftext|>
"Ouch. Looks like todays challenge is..."
<|endoftext|>
all wheel options are 'don't sleep with Niall' because he thinks it's a challenge
<|endoftext|>
she passes immediately
<|endoftext|>
*Crowd "Help, I'm being hit on by a Kevin Spacy impersonator"*
<|endoftext|>
*mumbles under breath* "Every fucking time."
<|endoftext|>
*Niall lies on a small boy and jacks off into a plant* (was that second one weinstein?)
<|endoftext|>
So i offered Ibiza (spain) or Zante (greece)
<|endoftext|>
anyone know any good destinations off the cuff?
<|endoftext|>
Rhodes and Crete are both pretty good, have a look on thomas cook?
<|endoftext|>
Benicassim doesn't appear to have a good line up this year. Wish I'd known about it last year. It had catfish, blossoms and all sorts
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
or not
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
said they were too heavy for your delicate little shoulders
<|endoftext|>
i was miffed cos you wouldn't wait for me to get the same tram
<|endoftext|>
I dislike being with you
<|endoftext|>
but you get rod out of the house, and he's sexy af
<|endoftext|>
right cya im going to work
<|endoftext|>
in a bit mate
<|endoftext|>
If you want summer idea's what about somewhere like croatia, beechy and probably quite cheap
<|endoftext|>
Know anywhere good there? Package places have a few different destinations
<|endoftext|>
no where specific, but youd presumably want the coast
<|endoftext|>
That's where the sea tends to be
<|endoftext|>
appaeantly split is good
<|endoftext|>
You wanna budget me? Don't wanna book something that's gonna be an issue for you or rod
<|endoftext|>
How do you feel about sharing a room?
<|endoftext|>
I don't mind; its normally a lot cheaper
<|endoftext|>
¬£666
<|endoftext|>
Actually they didn't have a gym
<|endoftext|>
Dibs sharing with josch if we're bunking up
<|endoftext|>
do you know how much we ended up spending going to dublin?
<|endoftext|>
I spent a fuckton
<|endoftext|>
Like a grand easy
<|endoftext|>
intersting that tui will send you on thomas cook flights...
<|endoftext|>
Just looking at flights or packages?
<|endoftext|>
was looking at packages, not convinced they're necicarially cheaper
<|endoftext|>
for refrence thomas cook do a weekly monday flight which if you got would cost ~200
<|endoftext|>
necicarially -J bomb, 2013
<|endoftext|>
OK, what about Airbnb and a flight then?
<|endoftext|>
No gym in an Airbnb
<|endoftext|>
*necessarily
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
I don't need a gym personally
<|endoftext|>
Bc you're a little twig pussy
<|endoftext|>
the apeal of a package would of course be the included meals
<|endoftext|>
I challenge you to an rowing machine or bike race anyday
<|endoftext|>
I'm unfit and I'm fine with that, I mostly just bench
<|endoftext|>
found this one but they only have double beds üò¢  https://www.thomascook.com/packages/H0204496/?contentId=6781ef8ccb502425bc827e9d632a1975b9cbdcd1581d9dbd&depAirport=MAN&duration=7&boardType=1&boardType=1&brand=AIR1&room=,2&room=,2&seasonCode=S19&freeChildFlag=No&selectedDate=2019-05-06&concepts=smartline&roomPackageId=AIR@47049&roomPackageId=AIR@47049&productId=H0204496&tid=637622&language=en&id=H0204496

I mean, if we're gonna do what we did last time and just spend a week hammered, then we may as well not bother with a nicer hotel

Sounds like a far cry country
<|endoftext|>
i did. sorry

<|endoftext|>
the problem was only 9-5
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505  It looks ok. not as good as the previous 2 imo
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
This sounds a lot like rape and I want no part in it
<|endoftext|>
Nooa
<|endoftext|>
Never heard of it
<|endoftext|>
Where's that? Who's playing?
<|endoftext|>
@(Not) Admin  Is anyone against going to a festival in spain?
<|endoftext|>
@Subby
<|endoftext|>
@everyone
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Anything against it?
<|endoftext|>
There's a chance artic monkeys or the strokes are gonna play
<|endoftext|>
at benicazim
<|endoftext|>
How much and when?
<|endoftext|>
it's only a maybe
<|endoftext|>
they release full line up in march but the news sites say probs one or even both
<|endoftext|>
only about ¬£250 for the full week with tents, full toilets and full showers
<|endoftext|>
Plus flights
<|endoftext|>
And food
<|endoftext|>
And drink
<|endoftext|>
Lots of drinks
<|endoftext|>
yeah (150 for the shitty camp ground with porta loos)
<|endoftext|>
yeah food and drink and stuff is extra
<|endoftext|>
$10 for the shuttle bus pass to and from town
<|endoftext|>
How much are flights?
<|endoftext|>
120 to 150
<|endoftext|>
ish
<|endoftext|>
all around 500 - 600 for the trip
<|endoftext|>
I reckon we buy the concert/good camp ground tickets now
<|endoftext|>
then get flights after we know the full line up
<|endoftext|>
My friend sold their ticket last year and made 40 quid (incase they dont get announced)
<|endoftext|>

@Rodney  Anything against going to a festival in spain for the holiday?
<|endoftext|>
Idk, depends what those two want to do
<|endoftext|>
its pretty cool tho
<|endoftext|>
you gett the camp ground for the week but there's only 3 days of music
<|endoftext|>
people go to the beach (20mins away) or the water park (shuttle bus) or the town and stuff
<|endoftext|>
on the none festival days
<|endoftext|>
yeah like I said, I'll go if they are
<|endoftext|>
not a fan of festivals tbh
<|endoftext|>
have you been to any?
<|endoftext|>
that sounds like a nightmare to me
<|endoftext|>
festivals are awesome
<|endoftext|>
we pay extra for the middle class camp ground, dont worrk about that
<|endoftext|>
the camp grounds great
<|endoftext|>
no rain
<|endoftext|>
and you get like 3 days to do normal spain stuff, like beach or shit
<|endoftext|>
rodney's afraid of the middle class
<|endoftext|>
say that it's priority or some shit
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
For Josch, @Tyranulous . You have anything against going to a festival in spain? Benicazim 2019 , July about 15th to 22nd.  ¬£250 for the middle level camp ground (proper toilets, showers and safes with electricity) + ¬£120 for flights + food & drink cost. About ¬£500 overall i think.
<|endoftext|>
he won't come
<|endoftext|>

@everyone  As you guys don't seem keen on going somewhere beachy, lu and me were thinking of going Amsterdam. ¬£100 flights, we can split an air bnb for like ¬£50pp - then i guess about ¬£100 for sustenance. So around ¬£250ish. Would you guys prefer that?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Would you actually come? Seriously. We could go somewhere cheaper i guess but it'll probs be shit.
<|endoftext|>
no. thats a nice price
<|endoftext|>
would you prefer it to a beach hol?
<|endoftext|>
250 for a week is good
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
Come rod, it'll be fun
<|endoftext|>
Coast doubles price of everything
<|endoftext|>
is it cold?
<|endoftext|>
No
<|endoftext|>
ok thats good
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
No I mean book the week in advance
<|endoftext|>
When I go in tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
oh ok
<|endoftext|>
i can do any date after the 15th of this month. Just need to know how many weekends im missing
<|endoftext|>
Probably 1 or 2
<|endoftext|>
Can book flights around it
<|endoftext|>
Do you want to then rod? You have a vote, tell us what you wanna do instead of just not turning up :p

<|endoftext|>
Wanna sell some drugs for me?
<|endoftext|>
Get a job at a bar doing bar-backing. It's long shifts and it's fucking awful at most places but you can earn that in like 2 weekends, maybe three if you don't fight for your wage (verbally).
<|endoftext|>
You'll make that in one weekend working for me
<|endoftext|>

So you know how we all hate ourselves? Who wants to do drunk souls with chaos randomiser on at some point?
<|endoftext|>
we might die
<|endoftext|>
the one with the double damage ring?
<|endoftext|>
lol no
<|endoftext|>
random enemies, random items, random drops
<|endoftext|>
so first hollow might be manus
<|endoftext|>
but manus might be a lizard
<|endoftext|>
ive seen the random item and drop runs but never the random enemies
<|endoftext|>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mZfWK7LlxI
<|endoftext|>
and then drunk souls
<|endoftext|>
or, if you think we'd poison ourselves, then I'd settle for just the weapon randomiser thingy on a timer
<|endoftext|>
either way we probably die
<|endoftext|>
sure dude, whatever i guess
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney you wanna die?
<|endoftext|>
punk
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney you fuckin punk

@Rodney  sapnu puas
<|endoftext|>
shouldn't have watched that on a bad quality live stream. meh
<|endoftext|>
|| Best scene was the one between sansa and tyrion contemplating suicide||
<|endoftext|>
|| fuckin Theon should have been the one to kill him if they wanted the unexpected route||
<|endoftext|>
||Bran was written awfully. Ghost is fucked. John was useless. The fucking front line should have died immediately, so many characters alive for no reason - they should have atleast had some random extras still alive to make it more realistic, but no, only the popular people.||
<|endoftext|>
||I liked melisandra stuff but i wish she had stopped after the trench. She got over her crisis of faith üòÉ , she should have suicide bombed. Beric should have died more beautifully - i know he saved Aria but ... come on... he was brought back so many times for a purpose and this one seems dull||
<|endoftext|>
||The death of the horse riders and the giant was cool.||
<|endoftext|>
Alot of people are saying it was very hard to tell who was who in the chaos and are just asking if random people are dead in the chat. The 30min Bran lap-dance scene was tastefully done, proved he was a real boy.
<|endoftext|>
||oh and poor jorah. I thought he'd live after he survived the first charge||
<|endoftext|>
|| oh yeah, the crypt is meant to be full of magic for the express purpose of not being effected by the undead magic. welp. The scene was pretty fucking brutal but i didn't like the inaccuracy.||
<|endoftext|>
||grey worm did bloody shut the moat on a company of his brothers. fuckin dark.||
<|endoftext|>
|| what was the fuckin point of the scene where the night king was lit on dragon-fire. (I guess it excuses the scenes from last season when the dragon died beyond the wall) Edit: maybe he is a Targaryen ||
<|endoftext|>
||the only death i really was shocked about was bear girl. Jorah and Melisandre deaths were poetic and worthwhile)||
<|endoftext|>
props to them for including some dudes from the vale, even the split second added alot to the realism. Fuckin awesome music tho.
<|endoftext|>
I've been thinking this for a while: Do the God's of the 7 actually exist? It's very likely that the old gods and the fire/light god exists due to their respective magic and in the books there is a little bit of drowned god magic, but never any magic of the 7.
<|endoftext|>
||I doubt many people would want to march south, tho the cheering in the preview indicates different. the north should be safe cos mount calin and the Neck is fully manned cos they didn't join the fight.||
<|endoftext|>
||Poor Mourmonts. oh and Jon just saw Sam being attacked and just walked off.||
<|endoftext|>
|| OK; in a vaccum, the episode was really cool. In context, it was a bloody shambles.||

Did this Belguim guy get anything for his trouble? That's 3.5 years of electricity plus maybe even more for backup. He can't really pattent his code either i don't think

He picked the wrong puzzle then tbh

9
<|endoftext|>
damn, he's got a large body count of child soldiers than no longer count then
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
for legal reasons, I'd like to point out that it's 16 if they're female

@Louie1505  Do you recon they'll pull an avengers and have a bunch of various  reinforcements show up for the final battle
<|endoftext|>
like the other lords that were mentioned
<|endoftext|>
there's no other way they can win that battle
<|endoftext|>
they brought one to king's landing remember?
<|endoftext|>
a wight
<|endoftext|>
and yes, defo
<|endoftext|>
proof for the common people, like right now there is nothing. Just normal bones. Cersie can just deny it happened. which southerner would believe them

the wight magic is 100% gone and only the north remembers

Why skip the scene of bran and jon revealing the secret to sansa and aria? what was the fucking point in not scripting it
<|endoftext|>
it was 1 and a half hours long. why not show the pay off. it would have been a fucking great scene

it's so very different from any comic source material, like no matching material i mean

they just took the likeness of like 4 1960's villians and mysterio and given them a completely new background
<|endoftext|>
excited for them to rip off spiderverse, how many spidermens you think there will be?
<|endoftext|>
spider verse was a shit tone of different spiderman comic book arks that each got great reviews, spiderverse combined them and missed a shit tone of stuff

The first 2 tyrion scenes are very good
<|endoftext|>
||Tv-Tyrion was the only well written thing this episode (edit: until half way)||
<|endoftext|>
||They pretty much told sam to get fucked for no reason (unless sam's idea is GRRMs actual ending and D&D are telling *him* to get fucked)||
<|endoftext|>
||wtf sansa, bran is from the north, they ain't kneeling to no southern king||
<|endoftext|>
||Aria appearing out of nowhere is just so meh||
<|endoftext|>
||Are we supposed to believe that only like 12 noble houses still exist? There is still fucking tens if not hundreds of them||
<|endoftext|>
||Grey worms final destination was sad but satisfying as he's going to go protect Narth, Jon's is sorta where he should be in tv canon (edit: not anymore, now he's wild) and aria is going to go drown for no reason||
<|endoftext|>
||The episode feels so weird? What's with all the jokes and weird camera work? why does everyone have a great tan?||
<|endoftext|>
|| I did like the stark alien/non westerosi style of dany's speach highlighting how wrong she is for the place. Tho there was enough facist imagry. Needed more mussolini in her||
<|endoftext|>
||sam shouldn't be on the high council. I'd say bron too but who'd replace him?||
<|endoftext|>
||Aria and Sansa's endings were so fucking stupid and against character. Sansa is all alone in a place that never felt like home and Aria has never expressed any desire to go west - better characters have tried and failed, how the fuck is she gonna do it||
<|endoftext|>
||Jon's not been punished in the slightest. He's gonna fuck like crazy and raise a shit tone of little wildling targaryans||
<|endoftext|>
It wasn't completely awful but it was close; it all felt so illogical, ignored their story arcs/setup and went against character motivations. (then again i was spoiled so i had most of the week to slowly lose my anger) (edit: Why skip a few weeks in the middle instead of showing some pretty important fucking scenes?  wtf is it with this season and skipping big reveals and important scenes like we don't want to watch it?)
<|endoftext|>
What a waste
<|endoftext|>
||Props for petting ghost tho, only good thing about it||
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Your opinion?
<|endoftext|>
Mine is pretty meh, then again it could be cos you made me angry about it in advance so im not raging now
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505 Why did everyone have a tan?

<|endoftext|>

Rodney, is bill your hero?
<|endoftext|>
more than that
<|endoftext|>
wrong channel
<|endoftext|>
He is your daddy?
<|endoftext|>
no.
<|endoftext|>
Monica Lewinsky is  tho
<|endoftext|>
Woah
<|endoftext|>
you pulled that name out fast
<|endoftext|>
Monica Bellucci?
<|endoftext|>
that means your either googled the quote
<|endoftext|>
or know a little too much about this
<|endoftext|>
I cannot forget Monica Lewinsky
<|endoftext|>
I feel like Rodney doesn't know who Bill Clinton is
<|endoftext|>
your first wank?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
I respect her strength
<|endoftext|>
especially now she's campaigning to help others
<|endoftext|>
how do you know about her rod?
<|endoftext|>
she did not have sex with Bill
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
How do you know?
<|endoftext|>
oh please
<|endoftext|>
Why is rodney called that?
<|endoftext|>
isn't he the intern? is he banging himself? that's unsanitary
<|endoftext|>
is that Rami Malek?
<|endoftext|>
that's talent
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
Honestly, ever since i started wearing eye-liner i haven't goon home without a snog
<|endoftext|>
geez
<|endoftext|>
my hands are still shaking. I got so high, and so high quality it triggered hallucinations
<|endoftext|>
Also Ryan redford got really drunk then did a shit tonne of cocaine
<|endoftext|>
the hallucinations are wier#d
<|endoftext|>
also i snogged a very nice girl but i didn't feel like it ususally does. Hopefully it's just the drugs, not that im turning colder
<|endoftext|>
i got stone cold rejected by a dude when i tried to get in the taxi to his house party
<|endoftext|>
(jaw rot is kicking in)
<|endoftext|>
Sorry, you wear eyeliner?
<|endoftext|>
no need to apologise
<|endoftext|>
and it fucking works
<|endoftext|>
Oh, I barfed last night.
<|endoftext|>
Did better than @Tyranulous  and @Rodney  tho cos i got it in the plastic cup hole
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

I'll go if he does
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Feel like that assumptions based on flawed logic
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney when was the last time you had fun?
<|endoftext|>
2 weeks ago
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
dont do it
<|endoftext|>
woah now im conflicted
<|endoftext|>
listen to the devil or the angel?
<|endoftext|>
Technically I outrank rodney, but in fairness he probably cares more about not seeing it than I do about seeing it
<|endoftext|>
make your choice
<|endoftext|>
wanna play RoR2?
<|endoftext|>
heck yeah
<|endoftext|>
nevermind
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
next to 42s
<|endoftext|>
i couldn't get it up so her friends saved me
<|endoftext|>
^
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
he was gonna get pegged
<|endoftext|>
oohh
<|endoftext|>
second story
<|endoftext|>
so hannah and charlotte was there with like 3 other friends really high as fuck

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Combine the 1st with the 4th so Billy can join them together. Head for the forest and Billy will tell you that he needs a map Head again and this time he will enter the forest
<|endoftext|>
Head for the forest and Billy will tell you that he needs a map Head again and this time he will enter the forest
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney we completed it
<|endoftext|>
Billy died
<|endoftext|>
you missed the best m night shlamadon surprise twist
<|endoftext|>
I'm still in shock
<|endoftext|>
They should replace James Gunn on all his projects
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney , in hindsight, it was really weird for you to force us to play that russina incest porn game
<|endoftext|>
It's natural
<|endoftext|>
I'd completely forgotten that Arrested Development had a whole plot arc in like 2013 about putting up a wall to keep out the Mexicans
<|endoftext|>
life imitates art or did drumpf fall asleep with basic cable on?
<|endoftext|>
how dare you, Arrested Development is premium shit
<|endoftext|>
season 1-3 only
<|endoftext|>
or 4. dont remember
<|endoftext|>
4 wasn't great
<|endoftext|>
Rodney' character and michael cera's character are very similar
<|endoftext|>
woah when did i become a registered sex offender?
<|endoftext|>
I'd argue you're more similar, given that one of the major plot points is that he wants to bang his cousin
<|endoftext|>
2015?
<|endoftext|>
damn, i hoped you'd not make that joke
<|endoftext|>
low hanging fruit man
<|endoftext|>
in fairness, I'd bang her if she was my cousin (from season 4 onwards, pls don't arrest me)
<|endoftext|>
@Misery is that better?
<|endoftext|>
ill take it
<|endoftext|>
yeah I bet you will
<|endoftext|>
never actually participated in a good dogging
<|endoftext|>
like not since last night or?
<|endoftext|>
oh
<|endoftext|>
does that count?
<|endoftext|>
does to me
<|endoftext|>
why are you tring to swoop me in with george michael
<|endoftext|>
we moved past that rod, keep up
<|endoftext|>
because the singer wants your ass and the character wants you to shower with him
<|endoftext|>
Who'd fuck George Michael's corpse?
<|endoftext|>
(if anything i'm most surprised that rod knows what dogging is)
<|endoftext|>
sometimes all you can find is a car park
<|endoftext|>
and a few lonely ladies
<|endoftext|>
in your area
<|endoftext|>
rod, do you know what it is?
<|endoftext|>
would you like for me to arrange an evening?
<|endoftext|>
rod, you should try it
<|endoftext|>
none of that gimp shit your into tho
<|endoftext|>
go vanilla and enjoy the experiance
<|endoftext|>
some of us can't cum unless we fear for our life Niall, don't judge
<|endoftext|>
i pity them
<|endoftext|>
what is dogging?
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
a good time
<|endoftext|>
sure
<|endoftext|>
let's see what urban dictionary has to say
<|endoftext|>
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dogging

<|endoftext|>
ahhh. that makes sense
<|endoftext|>
love the enthusiasm
<|endoftext|>
the name makes sense
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
how???
<|endoftext|>
they just sell them
<|endoftext|>
there is no overt rule that you have to do it doggy style and there is no dogs involved
<|endoftext|>
thats what dogs do. and nial
<|endoftext|>
same difference
<|endoftext|>
damn rod
<|endoftext|>
and other wierd animals
<|endoftext|>
ice cold
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Pinned a message.

<|endoftext|>
Do you think I made the vid? I don't have any bts footage, sorry
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
@Misery tell jus why that's your name
<|endoftext|>
im not ashamed
<|endoftext|>
Try to be pls
<|endoftext|>
ok, a litttle looking back
<|endoftext|>
i think my come down happened today and not yesterday
<|endoftext|>
i hated myself when i woke up today
<|endoftext|>
Just tell the story you goth bitch
<|endoftext|>
I fingered a girl in a car park outside 42s as she rubbed me until her friends came and got her. Happy?
<|endoftext|>
i think i desevered some fun
<|endoftext|>
last week i had to stop someone from killing themselves for 2 hours
<|endoftext|>
(also i was high so it was probs best her friends came and got her cos i wasn't gonna get har)
<|endoftext|>
Can you please change 'got her' to 'saved her'?
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
man she was fucking climbing me
<|endoftext|>
i needed to be saved
<|endoftext|>
Not an image I wanted
<|endoftext|>
but one you deserved
<|endoftext|>
It'll help my throw up my dinner so I can be a skinny girl
<|endoftext|>
I think I might need to close some tabs
<|endoftext|>
Nah, got 1.2gig free
<|endoftext|>
Open more
<|endoftext|>
It's noticably slowed down
<|endoftext|>
You could do with moving to win10 though, that's graphs ugly af
<|endoftext|>
ah yes what an exelent reason to switch
<|endoftext|>
although tbf the win10 task manager is far superior
<|endoftext|>
Yeah it's miles better
<|endoftext|>
I suspect this isnt helping my memory too
<|endoftext|>
delete all those balckmail folders you have named after us
<|endoftext|>
the ones with all the photos in
<|endoftext|>
Because those are held in memory üòõ
<|endoftext|>
more space to thrash man
<|endoftext|>
thats nasty
<|endoftext|>
what?
<|endoftext|>
that image
<|endoftext|>
yeah josch, get owned
<|endoftext|>
I like that he didn't call either of mine nasty
<|endoftext|>
Those are fine
<|endoftext|>
But joschs task manager is too far
<|endoftext|>
i removed them from my mind
<|endoftext|>
I'll email them to you
<|endoftext|>
you dont have to
<|endoftext|>
Carrier pigeon?
<|endoftext|>
Don't worry, it's no trouble rod
<|endoftext|>
I'll cc those two
<|endoftext|>
@everyone should we book next month soon? Be worth getting a place to stay earlier, probably a bit cheaper
<|endoftext|>
i get paid around the 5th next month
<|endoftext|>
We go the Monday after I think
<|endoftext|>
Our at least that's what I have booked off
<|endoftext|>
Or*
<|endoftext|>
cool. how long should i book off?
<|endoftext|>
A week?
<|endoftext|>
Ask them too
<|endoftext|>
They won't answer
<|endoftext|>
Rod is a pussy
<|endoftext|>
a hairy one
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
the dates are on the image you sent
<|endoftext|>
genius
<|endoftext|>
i know but it seemed so far away laast time i checked
<|endoftext|>
they all seem earlier this year, nice to see
<|endoftext|>
some were 3/4 am last year
<|endoftext|>
I  don't like that they called used BST instead of GMT
<|endoftext|>
It's one a of the good things about britian is we are in the best time zone
<|endoftext|>
the american's are trying to de-legitimise it
<|endoftext|>
@TimmyThyme  What game you wanna see at e3?
<|endoftext|>
nintendogs?
<|endoftext|>
tetris 98?
<|endoftext|>
mario maker 3d?
<|endoftext|>
we're not on gmt right now
<|endoftext|>
it's summer
<|endoftext|>
but why not just use dst
<|endoftext|>
why the B
<|endoftext|>
it feels off
<|endoftext|>
that's not a real timezone
<|endoftext|>
we move to BST timezone in summer
<|endoftext|>
but why call it britsh. It effect the whole time zone
<|endoftext|>
if i was morrocan i'd be pissed
<|endoftext|>
no it doesn't lol, some countries don't observe daylight savings at all, some do it at different points in year
<|endoftext|>
it's a mess
<|endoftext|>
BST is specifically our way of doing it
<|endoftext|>
hence british
<|endoftext|>
also, gmt has the name of a place in britain
<|endoftext|>
we named both because we want to be the centre of the world
<|endoftext|>
because we suck
<|endoftext|>
i know but grenich has a is an observatory or somethin
<|endoftext|>
it's important
<|endoftext|>
the whole of britian is too vag
<|endoftext|>
*Morocco time rules. In 2018, the governement has announced that the country stays on GMT+1, and would not go back one hour on 28 October 2018, as previously scheduled*
<|endoftext|>
they did follow bst until last year
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505  see, morrocco is pissed
<|endoftext|>
that says they don't observe daylight savings at all
<|endoftext|>
clocks never go back
<|endoftext|>
as previously scheduled
<|endoftext|>
they used to
<|endoftext|>
they angry, as they should be
<|endoftext|>
that really isn't what that says
<|endoftext|>
at all
<|endoftext|>
it is. they are no longer observing the DST.
<|endoftext|>
eveyone just refers to it as BST. they pissed people are not calling it MDST. now they just GMT+1 forever
<|endoftext|>
*not go back one hour on 28 October 2018, as previously scheduled. That means that Morocco time is the same as other countries in the West Africa time zone*

@Rodney Any advice from your long stint as tinder god?
<|endoftext|>
There are so many pins you could've used as a better quote
<|endoftext|>
what's wrong with that one?
<|endoftext|>
He didn't say it
<|endoftext|>
no, he sung it to us
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Didn't you, you little misogynists
<|endoftext|>
i know they're there
<|endoftext|>
yeah but they're so good
<|endoftext|>
wouldn't have really worked for as cocky guy as rodney tho when he's trying to attract some more women
<|endoftext|>
If he got any more puss he'd drown
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney I might have to give a presentation in Birmingham, how should I open it?

@TimmyThyme  wtahcing now
<|endoftext|>
I dislike the sun/moon asthetic quite alot but the visable pokemon's seem great
<|endoftext|>
i hope theirs a joke about a plant pokemon in an office being a potted plant
<|endoftext|>
I'm not overly fond of the newer aesthetics in general either, may just be a nostalgia thing though... Pretty hopeful though
<|endoftext|>
i like the fact the gym battles are in front of a crowd, makes it seem more realistic
<|endoftext|>
on a side note
<|endoftext|>
back to poke. dynamix looks silly
<|endoftext|>
oh, sif from dark souls is the new legendery
<|endoftext|>
why no proper multiplayer tho
<|endoftext|>
i hope they're just keeping coy about it
<|endoftext|>
probs not, they are proper wasting the IP
<|endoftext|>
Assuming that grass leader is the first gym, you're gonna unlock dynamax real early in the game...
<|endoftext|>
lol nerd
<|endoftext|>
i thot he was bug?
<|endoftext|>
If it's unlocked real early it might really tie in with a multiplayer feature, like the raid's pokemon is not a random one but a random player's poke instead
<|endoftext|>
i was actually looking forward to dark phoenix
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
it was doomed to fail, it was inevitable
<|endoftext|>
Just like Rodney
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney wanna go to legoland?
<|endoftext|>
Why that?
<|endoftext|>
it's fun for all the family
<|endoftext|>
I'll pick you up in an hour?
<|endoftext|>
ok?
<|endoftext|>
cool
<|endoftext|>
Cool
<|endoftext|>
damn, i missed out
<|endoftext|>
their probs already dogging in the legoland carpark by now
<|endoftext|>
@everyone Which motherfucker has two thumbs and just got a new phone (with insurance this time)?
<|endoftext|>
this guy üëç  üëç
<|endoftext|>
Send your tinder pics in now
<|endoftext|>
does that mean people can actually contact you now
<|endoftext|>
yep. YAY!!
<|endoftext|>
what'd you get?
<|endoftext|>
i have unlimited call and texts for the first time in my life
<|endoftext|>
nokia 3.1 or something
<|endoftext|>
isn't that what jus had before he threw it at my floor?
<|endoftext|>
lol, i hope not. whatever jos likes i have to h8, that's the rule
<|endoftext|>
he likes black people
<|endoftext|>
so i h8 them
<|endoftext|>
same
<|endoftext|>
for different reasons
<|endoftext|>
that's the name of the game everybody
<|endoftext|>
actually the name of the game is "Kill That N-Word"
<|endoftext|>
yeah, let's fucking go out and kill some nonces
<|endoftext|>
been too long since the last nonce hunt
<|endoftext|>
burn that witch
<|endoftext|>
so since you're out buying fancy new phones, am I gonna have to send some of my collectors over? Rodney breaks shin bones with his teeth
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
the existential dispair of being trapped in a single moment in time
<|endoftext|>
that niall is long dead
<|endoftext|>
long live the niall
<|endoftext|>
I actually hope he dies soon
<|endoftext|>
yeah, bring the new niall in, he's hella horny
<|endoftext|>
gross
<|endoftext|>
hevan
<|endoftext|>
so speaking of, what's the deal tomorrow?
<|endoftext|>
trying to find another car park girl or?
<|endoftext|>
I hope so . we'll do whatever. rodney doesn't want to go clubbing. i want to get off my tits. If we do end up in town i'll go anywhere but 42s.
<|endoftext|>
cool
<|endoftext|>
I've been sober for some amount of time which was horrible for me, so getting fucked up
<|endoftext|>
although in fairness I've been drunk since about 10am
<|endoftext|>
don;t worry about it
<|endoftext|>
damn lu
<|endoftext|>
you wanna smoke tomorrow then?
<|endoftext|>
not really
<|endoftext|>
i'm too early to do md again. i guess you could get some if you wanted. I'm up for coke. I don't think i can get 2c-b from anyone on short notice
<|endoftext|>
told you, I'm vaguely sober, I'm just drinking
<|endoftext|>
oh, by 'fucked up' i thought you meant more than booze
<|endoftext|>
so how's your wingman game after going out with meth heads?
<|endoftext|>
we haven't been out in ages
<|endoftext|>
the past 3 weeks i've snogged every night out with one dry humping me in a car park.
<|endoftext|>
that might have been the worst reply you could've chosen
<|endoftext|>
I feel ill
<|endoftext|>
tho, most of that's down to the eyeliner and the charisma i gain when im so fucking high i hug people
<|endoftext|>
it really isn't mate
<|endoftext|>
the eyeliner does 60% of the work
<|endoftext|>
I promise you it doesn't
<|endoftext|>
and I need you to believe me
<|endoftext|>
well that and i dance like a stripper whenever they play R U Mine
<|endoftext|>
I was wrong, that's worse than what you said before
<|endoftext|>
https://tenor.com/view/markiplier-stripper-gif-4956535
<|endoftext|>
anyway. I'll be in town tomorrow until about 2 or 3 ish, i cool to hang out anytime after that.
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505  we going out even if rod's not?
<|endoftext|>
what the fuck are you doing until then
<|endoftext|>
why did you @ me
<|endoftext|>
so you'd get the question
<|endoftext|>
I've been responding lol
<|endoftext|>
and to answer your question i'll be eating with a few of the 'meth heads' as you call them
<|endoftext|>
and I'm not invited? what is this shit
<|endoftext|>
it's sort of an intervention
<|endoftext|>
how are you gonna hold an intervention for me if I'm not there>
<|endoftext|>
lol, nah one of my friends isn't eating properly, you'd probs not want to be there
<|endoftext|>
we'll just end up force feeding him some fatty food
<|endoftext|>
sounds boring, don't care. I'll pick you up at some point, probably evening
<|endoftext|>
ok. what times?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney what time you doing things tomorrow?
<|endoftext|>
sometime between 12 and 00
<|endoftext|>
Not doing anything tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
*not doing anything important
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Can't bring my pc
<|endoftext|>

That is possibly the worst picture of anyone I have ever seen
<|endoftext|>
should it be placed 1st, 2nd ect
<|endoftext|>
that's not nice jos
<|endoftext|>
that's the worse pic i've ever jacked off too
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Well I wouldn't consider putting either on my tinder
<|endoftext|>
oh
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I don't
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
with insurance
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
do you have any good pics? im clutching at straws
<|endoftext|>
I was gone for like 15 mins ffs
<|endoftext|>
evidently
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
a picture can speak 1000 words
<|endoftext|>
that picture captures so much of who he is as a person
<|endoftext|>
that's my friend alex
<|endoftext|>
i told you it wasn't me
<|endoftext|>
he's snorting paracetonmol on the school bus
<|endoftext|>
any nice ones?
<|endoftext|>
(if not that reflects badly on you more than me)
<|endoftext|>
you need to do some situps man
<|endoftext|>
and get on that bench
<|endoftext|>
nah, that's fat. i need to do more anaerobic. and i know the bench stuff, i just don't have a bench
<|endoftext|>
i am a tree hugger
<|endoftext|>
why do you have so many pictures of him
<|endoftext|>
it's only from dublin
<|endoftext|>
I have like 4
<|endoftext|>
any when when we weren't on holiday and i begged you to take some
<|endoftext|>
what does that say
<|endoftext|>
any not from dublin?
<|endoftext|>
lol that's josch
<|endoftext|>
really?
<|endoftext|>
in dublin
<|endoftext|>
where?
<|endoftext|>
after he threw up
<|endoftext|>
on the floor outside
<|endoftext|>
when?
<|endoftext|>
in the smoking area
<|endoftext|>
after he barfed
<|endoftext|>
or before
<|endoftext|>
what?
<|endoftext|>
can't remember
<|endoftext|>
if it ws before or after
<|endoftext|>
ahhhhhhhhhhhh
<|endoftext|>
im wearing that tshirt now
<|endoftext|>
wow
<|endoftext|>
look at how little he is
<|endoftext|>
we were so young
<|endoftext|>
lol just came across this screenshot
<|endoftext|>
I also suggest that you be friends with her
<|endoftext|>
i came across you dad's face
<|endoftext|>
oh
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
where's that?
<|endoftext|>
why aren't any nice
<|endoftext|>
Jacksons boat
<|endoftext|>
yep
<|endoftext|>
oh haha, cool
<|endoftext|>
(because you're ugly, niall)
<|endoftext|>
i sorta like that one
<|endoftext|>
got the 'moors murderer' sorta vibe
<|endoftext|>
now that's a good pick at a really bad angle
<|endoftext|>
ahhhhh
<|endoftext|>
I look like a murderer
<|endoftext|>
you are?
<|endoftext|>
i was the victim
<|endoftext|>
long live the niall
<|endoftext|>
I murdered that sweet puss
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
am i drinking a cider? wtf
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
puss
<|endoftext|>
i don't miss him
<|endoftext|>
who's that?
<|endoftext|>
like at all
<|endoftext|>
i forgot he existed
<|endoftext|>
yahya
<|endoftext|>
that's pretty bad
<|endoftext|>
im a monster
<|endoftext|>
he was like a nicer version of josch
<|endoftext|>
but he gave better head
<|endoftext|>
Josch does get a bit too tooth-y
<|endoftext|>
anyway
<|endoftext|>
im pretty fucked then
<|endoftext|>
i don't wana use the guitar pic as no 1
<|endoftext|>
it gives the wrong impression
<|endoftext|>
that you're straight?
<|endoftext|>
i like grey hair one and now dislike the good one of me at the dublin coast
<|endoftext|>
feel like you're overthinking this
<|endoftext|>
people don't really look
<|endoftext|>
they just fuck ‚Ñ¢
<|endoftext|>
you're gonna get unmatched more than you'll get swiped left
<|endoftext|>
people spam match and then unmatch people after the fact
<|endoftext|>
ok
<|endoftext|>
but did you both hate grey hair?
<|endoftext|>
I'm more of a dark hair kinda guy
<|endoftext|>
You might not but girls deffo do
<|endoftext|>
not on tinder mate
<|endoftext|>
nobody gives a fuck
<|endoftext|>
thank you josch
<|endoftext|>
so
<|endoftext|>
should i listen the the angel or the devil?
<|endoftext|>
Basically anyone a girl swipes on will be a match so they think about it more
<|endoftext|>
yeah maybe
<|endoftext|>
the real question is who has more sex, niall
<|endoftext|>
yeah, men are whores
<|endoftext|>
(me)
<|endoftext|>
except the ugly ones maybe
<|endoftext|>
and jsoch has more sex
<|endoftext|>
does he though
<|endoftext|>
there's a bloody queue at this point
<|endoftext|>
I forgot that was an expletive for a sec and was wondering why the queue was covered in blood
<|endoftext|>
bloody because they're bleAding out
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
"bleading"  - tyranulous, oxford student
<|endoftext|>
, biggest dick in the west
<|endoftext|>
and tightest anus
<|endoftext|>
Spelling isn't an important entry requirement
<|endoftext|>
numbers can't be spelt wrong
<|endoftext|>
he only needs consent and he's in
<|endoftext|>
to oxford or your anus?
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
they also can jos
<|endoftext|>
nerds
<|endoftext|>
so many bottles
<|endoftext|>
good times
<|endoftext|>
careful that shelf might fall down
<|endoftext|>
hahahaha
<|endoftext|>
don't
<|endoftext|>
i still have nightmares
<|endoftext|>
I hope one day you have a bedside shelf above you
<|endoftext|>
face your fears
<|endoftext|>
no official fear of shelves but there is this:  parthophobia       fear of virgins
<|endoftext|>
lots of girls in 42s have that, eh niall?
<|endoftext|>
don't think so, they just didn't like me
<|endoftext|>
does josch know im not a virgin anymore?
<|endoftext|>
he was there
<|endoftext|>
he wishes
<|endoftext|>
could've helped me get the bloody condom on
<|endoftext|>
what now
<|endoftext|>
i didn't do it fucking raw you monster
<|endoftext|>
that wasn't what I was questioning (although you should. it's fine, condoms are a scam) - why was it so difficult?
<|endoftext|>
i don't know?
<|endoftext|>
first time putting in on i suppose
<|endoftext|>
it hurt a bit too
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
the condom or just the sex
<|endoftext|>
nah, the sex for me was awful, she came twice tho
<|endoftext|>
not sure why I asked when I didn't actually want to know
<|endoftext|>
you did
<|endoftext|>
you minx
<|endoftext|>
call it morbid curiosity
<|endoftext|>
call it whatever you want
<|endoftext|>
im just happy making you all smile with my disfunctional life
<|endoftext|>
it brings me graet joy
<|endoftext|>
pay the iron price
<|endoftext|>
help?
<|endoftext|>
any look like a no 1?
<|endoftext|>
you don't look happy in a single photo
<|endoftext|>
that's the point
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
only you can make me happy
<|endoftext|>
just no
<|endoftext|>
or somehtin
<|endoftext|>
please no
<|endoftext|>
i really hate my own smile
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
and I've rufeed it
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Yep
<|endoftext|>
Unlimited texts and calls, 500mg internet plus insurance for 17 quid
<|endoftext|>
i didn't ask
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
I don't care what it is
<|endoftext|>

Literally everywhere I go at the moment has eduroam
<|endoftext|>
what the fuck is a eduroam
<|endoftext|>
is that an std?
<|endoftext|>
wifi, used by basically every uni across the world
<|endoftext|>
don't think I've ever turned wifi on since I bought this phone
<|endoftext|>
wifi is for cucks
<|endoftext|>
ethernet or gtfo
<|endoftext|>
on your phone?
<|endoftext|>
What could be more convenient
<|endoftext|>
like how you spent 4 mins looking for both connectors so you could daisychain them for this picture
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
lies
<|endoftext|>
I also poured a drink

He can't walk straight anymore
<|endoftext|>
Do I want to know why?
<|endoftext|>
I'll let him describe it
<|endoftext|>
I got away with it, no one smelt weed or commented on my eyes, they just think i look a little pale
<|endoftext|>
and, ahhhhhhh burrito boy rodney is the best rodney
<|endoftext|>
Damn.
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
and it was my family and my aunty too
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
5/10 - don't rememeber much after i was real happy cos rodney got high
<|endoftext|>
Let's not do that again
<|endoftext|>
I want you in my bed again rod
<|endoftext|>
we shouldn't have let your first experience be in a club tbh, mine was in a house
<|endoftext|>
Well positively, your ability to handle stuff like that will be massively boosted and you haven't had an awful come-down cos of the weed in your system
<|endoftext|>
i didn't really like these pills
<|endoftext|>
Should've taken them rectally like I said
<|endoftext|>
boof
<|endoftext|>

https://www.twitch.tv/team/e3
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I'm dying for cyber punk
<|endoftext|>
well, that crowd guy just won e3
<|endoftext|>

MS Flight simulator

<|endoftext|>
wasteland 3 seems a real departure from the gritty looking first 2
<|endoftext|>
MS Excel :poggers:
<|endoftext|>
Poggers?
<|endoftext|>
shocked and cheerful emoji
<|endoftext|>
what a shitty gears trailer

game of souls
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
reaally none
<|endoftext|>
bloody hell
<|endoftext|>
seems like a fucking plain ass boring console.
<|endoftext|>
why not do what a bunch of hardware companies talked about the other year and create a console with easily updated parts?
<|endoftext|>
pc for kids
<|endoftext|>
tell daddy how big you are
<|endoftext|>
no halo gameplay üò¶
<|endoftext|>
tied to the console release üò¶
<|endoftext|>
The next person to send the word "poggers" is getting banned
<|endoftext|>
Naicu
<|endoftext|>
Idk what that means but I think you're banned too
<|endoftext|>
Any thots on E3 so far, apart from that dude who hit on Keanu reeves from the crowd?
<|endoftext|>
MS flight sim seems the coolest thing
<|endoftext|>
Elden ring didn't release any info üôÅ
<|endoftext|>
Bethseda- we added NPC's and a BR
<|endoftext|>
Haven't watched yet
<|endoftext|>
Went to sleep at like 8
<|endoftext|>
It was ok, bit more normal than last year. The Japanese game is worth paying attention to
<|endoftext|>
Is anyone else hyped for flight simulator????
<|endoftext|>
Why is there so many uni age people all walking around with suitcases?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Don't ask how I know
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney show us how hard you can get
<|endoftext|>
Ya
<|endoftext|>
Think it was super late though

Hopefully it's as fucking crazy as the last few years.

looks like a sci-fi version of Overlord
<|endoftext|>
called 'StarMancer', likes like a nice strategy base builder
<|endoftext|>
Chivalry 2, looks like just a straight upgrade, quite pretty.
<|endoftext|>
2.5x the lobby size
<|endoftext|>
new prop hunt clone with ghosts, meh
<|endoftext|>
top down rouge-like looks ok, something wayfarer something
<|endoftext|>
2 different top down Conon the barbarian games
<|endoftext|>
one like AoE and They are Billions, the other is another top down zelda-esque rouge-like
<|endoftext|>
missed some sci-fi horror tenacle game
<|endoftext|>
Last Oasis: multiplayer giant sand boats/vehicles fighting
<|endoftext|>
like that airship multiplayer battle arena game that came out a few years back
<|endoftext|>
weird
<|endoftext|>
for some reason they've made  Age of Wonders into a sci-fi?
<|endoftext|>
(it's an old fanasty TBS, now it's sci-fi)
<|endoftext|>
well it looks atleast as good as that civ space game that came out ages ago
<|endoftext|>
low bar to pass
<|endoftext|>
that fps sniper elite game has another zombie version coming out
<|endoftext|>
Zombie army 4: hitler's undead dick
<|endoftext|>
Remnant, looks pretty good, hunting large beasts with guns and a sweet dodge roll
<|endoftext|>
monster hunter but demons and guns
<|endoftext|>
griftlands: slay the spire  but with rpg style story
<|endoftext|>
ooohhh
<|endoftext|>
new planet coaster game
<|endoftext|>
'Planet Zoo'
<|endoftext|>
they're just gonna keep recreating tycoon games aren't they
<|endoftext|>
a virtual hippo just took a massive shit
<|endoftext|>
like diarea  shit. in the trailer.
<|endoftext|>
Shenmue 3

Per Aspera: cool looking terraforming Mars game
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Auto-chess standalone
<|endoftext|>
Shark Simulator, looks pretty great
<|endoftext|>
Terraria penulimate expansion, looks meh
<|endoftext|>
Balders Gate 3
<|endoftext|>
that's everything
<|endoftext|>
Fuck I'm gonna miss nintendo
<|endoftext|>
@TimmyThyme  @Rodney  you nerds, give me a play by play
<|endoftext|>
Breath of the wild sequel
<|endoftext|>
you don't have a social life, why would you miss it
<|endoftext|>
on way home from work
<|endoftext|>
buses were late, massive amount  of traffic and some inner city kids kicked the shit out of another kid in the road of the bus station slowing buses down more
<|endoftext|>
he deserved it
<|endoftext|>
no one tried to defend him then they all ran away cheering
<|endoftext|>
because they knew he deserved it
<|endoftext|>
Basically just the breath of the wild sequel was the only thing that actually excited me
<|endoftext|>
No metoid prime news ü§®
<|endoftext|>
Animal crossing got people excited
<|endoftext|>
They released Pok√©mon and Mario maker early for no reason, if they'd bundles them all together they would have won E3
<|endoftext|>
They have gameplay for 90% of their games which was great
<|endoftext|>
Made them better than most
<|endoftext|>
Don't get why they had that Pokemon direct last week and didn't just throw it in e3..
<|endoftext|>
The Nintendo treehouse showed alit of stuff, flick through it and you'll pribs be more excited
<|endoftext|>
You can buy CBD in Holland and Barrett, just need an id üßü
<|endoftext|>
I would be excited for some of the stuff they showed, only it'll be 2 years before I get to play it anyway. I was kinda hoping for more 'bigger games' to be announced for the future if anything
<|endoftext|>
Well apart from Mario and metroid, they already have recently. No new big IPs but that's to be expected
<|endoftext|>
In the past few years they've announced Mario, Zelda, pokmon,star fox, animal crossing and metroid massive sized games
<|endoftext|>
They dry
<|endoftext|>
There's always mario sunshine 2...
<|endoftext|>
Huh? Isn't that üçÑold?
<|endoftext|>
yeah, but still a nice game which i wouldn't mind a sequel for (even though it'll never happen)
<|endoftext|>
It might, my uncle works for GameCube, you don't know him, I'll ask him to force Sakuri and Kojena to make it
<|endoftext|>
Could you ask him to make Luigi's mansion 3 better and more like the original please üòÆ
<|endoftext|>
Could you ask him to undo what he did you in that shed when you were 9?
<|endoftext|>
Ninten-no to both
<|endoftext|>
is josch alive? he hasn't been active
<|endoftext|>
mate, josch has been dead for years
<|endoftext|>
are you ok?
<|endoftext|>
üëª :giles: üóØ :Capture:
<|endoftext|>
just caught up with devolver. weird af like always
<|endoftext|>
gotta love it
<|endoftext|>
and yes, i will take one of those gungeon arcade cabinets for my birthday, thank you
<|endoftext|>
"enter the gun dungeon" XD
<|endoftext|>
I will not be acknowledging your birthday, this or any year
<|endoftext|>
i've already hired you a stripper @Dyno
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
carrion looks sick btw
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
molested and killed
<|endoftext|>
i'm guessing he invested his dynamite money into several mexican  buisnesses and now he lives like a king with 3 concubines
<|endoftext|>
just like rodie
<|endoftext|>
fuck yeah
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
He was also in the failed US version of skins
<|endoftext|>

He frequently speaks to students at high schools and universities and is very involved with charitable organizations.*
<|endoftext|>
we were both wrong
<|endoftext|>
he's exactly like rodney
<|endoftext|>
and bethseda sucked so much ass
<|endoftext|>
the npc's are good but it's probs much too late to save it
<|endoftext|>
i'm guessing the BR will be laggy as shit
<|endoftext|>
did they even annouce doom 2 or is it a dlc?
<|endoftext|>
eternal yeah, was announced last year though
<|endoftext|>
(oh, the jap game looks sick tho)
<|endoftext|>
they just showed another trailer
<|endoftext|>
yeah true
<|endoftext|>
new arkane game looks cool
<|endoftext|>
studio that pretty consistently puts out good shit
<|endoftext|>
wassit called?, i dozed off during the doom bit
<|endoftext|>
deathloop
<|endoftext|>
don't remember
<|endoftext|>
people who put out dishonoured and prey
<|endoftext|>
2 secs
<|endoftext|>
ohhh
<|endoftext|>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4NsBsUbSy8>
<|endoftext|>
also look how tight this guy's fucking pants are
<|endoftext|>
game must be good
<|endoftext|>
wonder which looper you play?
<|endoftext|>
guessing you pick, like dishonoured 2
<|endoftext|>
and prey
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
just realised you pick in all their games
<|endoftext|>
better be a joseph gorden levit character dlc
<|endoftext|>
oh shit those guys made dark messiah
<|endoftext|>
forgot about that
<|endoftext|>
great game
<|endoftext|>
french too
<|endoftext|>
filth
<|endoftext|>
oh shit, when was hollow knight 2 announced
<|endoftext|>
I think i heard about it a few months back, some of the youtubers i watch know the devs
<|endoftext|>
i think e3 only said that the dlc was on swith tho didn't it? no trailer for 2
<|endoftext|>
think it showed a 2?
<|endoftext|>
there was a lot of good shit this year
<|endoftext|>
last year sucked
<|endoftext|>
i don't remember it
<|endoftext|>
all i remember is the some cinematics and some pricing hysteria
<|endoftext|>
gotta lay off them pills, bruh
<|endoftext|>
that's not it, i remember a bunch of cinematics but nothing i was excited for except the 5 second clips of elder scrolls and halo
<|endoftext|>
nothing else stands out
<|endoftext|>
Yeah Hollow knight 2 announced in feb, dlc stuff for switch at e3
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney wake up, you suck eggs
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505  https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-06-12-elden-ring-is-from-softwares-biggest-title-yet-in-terms-of-sheer-volume
<|endoftext|>
Holy fuck I'm excited now
<|endoftext|>
told you it would be good
<|endoftext|>
"Its themes include "eccentricity" and "the will, or ambition of mankind"" - gotta love Miyazaki
<|endoftext|>
I never doubted it'd be good. But now I'm fairly certain it'l be the game of a decade
<|endoftext|>
that's quite an assumption. I hope it's bad now, just to spite you
<|endoftext|>
It's the game I've always wanted, D's combat in a traditional RPG. Massively multiplayer is the only thing it's missing to be the game I die for
<|endoftext|>
doesn't say traditional RPG anywhere, just that they're focusing more on the RPG side of it
<|endoftext|>
that could mean doubling down on the DS type of RPG
<|endoftext|>
I didn't mean the leveling system
<|endoftext|>
I might that it'll probs have normal civilian NPC's, merchants and the like
<|endoftext|>
More magic too
<|endoftext|>
hopefully, an open world without being filled with stuff kills a game more than most things
<|endoftext|>
Hopefully they'll branch into more varied elemental magic and it's cool
<|endoftext|>
What game series is it based on ?
<|endoftext|>
Tales of something
<|endoftext|>
haven't heard that mentioned
<|endoftext|>
"a wider variety of "weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them""
<|endoftext|>
They started Dev before march 2017 which is good. Probs like 2 to 4 years away
<|endoftext|>
Hopefully they include stealth is what they're hinting at in that quote
<|endoftext|>
Maybe even crafting
<|endoftext|>
Oh God, if it beats elder Scrolls to market, what I'd it's just straight up better than it
<|endoftext|>
doubt it'll beat 6, but ES games stay relevant for years, I think they'll still be competing
<|endoftext|>
Tales of Arise
<|endoftext|>
Cool two planet world, one rich and one poor
<|endoftext|>
ur poor
<|endoftext|>
I guess Martin will take that and make it his own
<|endoftext|>
Look at the ign leak more info
<|endoftext|>
yeah, vaati has an in with one of the devs
<|endoftext|>
I know it's based probs in Norse myth, do you think they'll be other races?
<|endoftext|>
Playable races
<|endoftext|>
If there is it'll just be human shaped ones
<|endoftext|>
No dwarves or giant players
<|endoftext|>
I hope we get to rape, like real vikings
<|endoftext|>
Better sex than the Witcher
<|endoftext|>
Better combat than DS and Sekiro
<|endoftext|>
Better role play than Skryrim
<|endoftext|>
Better crafting than MC
<|endoftext|>
Better magic than all of them combined
<|endoftext|>
Anything less and I'll kill someone
<|endoftext|>
there a lot of games that fit several of those description
<|endoftext|>
for the first one especially, i'll pm you some links
<|endoftext|>
RIP
<|endoftext|>
Sick bastard
<|endoftext|>
he posted a public execution on social media
<|endoftext|>
why are you looking at josch's fb posts from 2012?
<|endoftext|>
why aren't you?
<|endoftext|>
It's where the juiciest stuff is
<|endoftext|>
now he just posts dick-picks on snapchat, which is a little boring
<|endoftext|>
I feel like @Tyranulous should ban you for this
<|endoftext|>
Fuk me snapmaps scares the shit out of me
<|endoftext|>
especially with josch on there
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
making ok music does not mean you have dress sense

@Tyranulous You got her pregnant yet?

Gotta be honest it looks beautiful and all but i really dislike the characters. I don't want to play as any of them
<|endoftext|>
cool @ 16:20  he says you can create your own character
<|endoftext|>
@everyone  Right, this will be the last time I ask sorry, but do any of you have any pics of me outside, every decent pic I have us me alone in a dark room
<|endoftext|>
I don't like that one of me by the sea very much but I'll have to go with it otherwise
<|endoftext|>
I swaer there vwas several versions of the pic but I only have one
<|endoftext|>
Fuck off feg
<|endoftext|>
If it makes you feel any better about what pic you choose; you won't get laid regardless
<|endoftext|>
I think you're the one who took the pics by the sea the in Dublin
<|endoftext|>
Just send us them
<|endoftext|>
Id do it for you
<|endoftext|>
I just needed one vof me outside
<|endoftext|>
I deleted all but the one I sent you
<|endoftext|>
That one
<|endoftext|>
Yeah but there was like 4 of them, I prefer one of them
<|endoftext|>
I didn't delete that one, you picked that one for your profile when we were over there
<|endoftext|>
Shit, skills are getting a re-do during the summer
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
But you're not asleep and you said you have this page muted right?
<|endoftext|>

I thought you'd be interested in it as you play the game
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
What a strange new character
<|endoftext|>
I'd fuck it
<|endoftext|>
Very creative (I hope they add in all the OG chars tho)
<|endoftext|>
Can't wait for sniper and astrid (poison lizard) if they do it.
<|endoftext|>
or a HAN-D (big robot with a hammer than has an overclock ability like a bezerker)
<|endoftext|>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTmJJ8dBT9U>  Am actually quite excited for this game now, looks like it's more of the same but with a bunch of changes to bring  it up to date. BL2 feels really old after playing any recent shooter
<|endoftext|>
also the guns don't sound like nerf guns anymore which is nice
<|endoftext|>

I'm too scared to look for Johnson, cos we all know it's just going to be a dick
<|endoftext|>
johnson is one of the most common second names
<|endoftext|>
and also a polite slang word for a cock
<|endoftext|>
also you spelt my german second name wrong
<|endoftext|>
i prefer it spelt that way
<|endoftext|>
change
<|endoftext|>
I doubt you even know how to spell it correctly
<|endoftext|>

your family has a website
<|endoftext|>
omg
<|endoftext|>
it doesn't actually do anything
<|endoftext|>
just links to other pages
<|endoftext|>
it does everything
<|endoftext|>
I'm now sponsored
<|endoftext|>
did you delete it?
<|endoftext|>
why are like 5 lines missing
<|endoftext|>
5 lines missing?
<|endoftext|>
one of those links is super dodgy josc
<|endoftext|>
it tries to store data on my device
<|endoftext|>
err no
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
which one
<|endoftext|>
biodiversity
<|endoftext|>
aka asking for permission to store cookies...
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous I am gonna hijack your website, sorry
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

217.160.0.102 is getting remapped to gay porn
<|endoftext|>
how anyway
<|endoftext|>
it's not even https
<|endoftext|>
that would give away the fun
<|endoftext|>
you'll inherit nothing
<|endoftext|>
can't do an injection
<|endoftext|>
why would you import jquery and then not even use it
<|endoftext|>
gotta drive home, we will pick this up shortly
<|endoftext|>
because whoever made it didn't actually code it
<|endoftext|>
they just edited a pre made thing
<|endoftext|>
*'They...'*? there were co-conspirators?
<|endoftext|>
they can be used as a gender neutral 3rd person singular
<|endoftext|>
i thought your dad was a man, treat him like one
<|endoftext|>
But shouldn't be
<|endoftext|>
making some serious assumptions here, girls can "code" too
<|endoftext|>
darn he got us, gender equality strikes again
<|endoftext|>
we assumed it was gile's site because it linked to all his work pages, we never considered it could be a fan site
<|endoftext|>
built by gile's number one fan
<|endoftext|>
the first 2 links are to stuff my mum admins
<|endoftext|>
praise be to the german church
<|endoftext|>
How are girls meant to code if they can't read the words?
<|endoftext|>
oh shit we missed a really obvious joke yesterday
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Happy late fathers day
<|endoftext|>
You're a joke
<|endoftext|>
my whole life is, im the punchline actually
<|endoftext|>

I've spent like 60 quid on vitemins this month
<|endoftext|>
I don't have a response to that
<|endoftext|>
"vitemins"?
<|endoftext|>
all it's done is make me angrier and hornier
<|endoftext|>
I don't have a response to that either
<|endoftext|>
I can't be the only guy that did your mum
<|endoftext|>

Hi Roger, we're 3 male friends from england who want to spend a week away in Dublin.  We would be out exploring the city most of the time so would be clean and quiet. Having read your description you're place looks like it would be the perfect place to stay the potential noise, cctv and stairs not being a problem. Looking forward to hearing from you, -Josch

<|endoftext|>
Where do I send
<|endoftext|>
can you dead drop it under that bridge between mine and stretford?
<|endoftext|>
where the corpses dance among the pond lillies
<|endoftext|>
she has accepted us into her home and her life
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Serious question. What do you will be different in the near future, mostly technology wise.
<|endoftext|>
I just can't get that image of the Amazon blimp unloading a bunch of drones out if my mind
<|endoftext|>
Like, will the Manchester skyline just be full of 'mobile distribution centres' like blimps full of different logos and adverts
<|endoftext|>
What is your obsession with cats this week
<|endoftext|>
ive been using the cats for ages
<|endoftext|>
Nobody is gonna be going outside
<|endoftext|>
Clearly you don't message us enough then
<|endoftext|>
Using them for what? Self gratification?
<|endoftext|>
How so? Why?
<|endoftext|>
They're very tight
<|endoftext|>
https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/19/oxford-receive-biggest-single-donation-stephen-schwarzman
<|endoftext|>
bet this went right into Josch's pocket
<|endoftext|>
filthy embezzlement
<|endoftext|>
He won't let then
<|endoftext|>
He reached into Joschs dirty pocket and rattled around
<|endoftext|>
Filthy Indeed
<|endoftext|>
Maintained eye contact through out
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney elaborate man
<|endoftext|>
Why? Acid rain? Secret police? Drones? Surveillance? I NEED TO KNOW
<|endoftext|>
Josch's pockets are just full of gold coins and embroidered handkerchiefs
<|endoftext|>
And wealthy semen
<|endoftext|>
...
<|endoftext|>
...
<|endoftext|>
Anyway, when's josch back?
<|endoftext|>
never, now you've said that
<|endoftext|>
The wealthiest, it's a compliment. He sure knows how to pick 'em
<|endoftext|>
(and how to dick 'em)
<|endoftext|>
Come home soon Jos
<|endoftext|>
I feel like we don't know that, he could do a very poor job
<|endoftext|>
Only one way to find out. I nominate Rodney as tribute
<|endoftext|>
No, I won't let him be scarred like I was. I'll do it
<|endoftext|>
I'll do it to protect Rodney
<|endoftext|>
and not for any other reasons
<|endoftext|>
Katpiss everdeep over here, volunteering as tribute to protect rods ass
<|endoftext|>
Genuinely think you've been worshipping that joke for 20 hours
<|endoftext|>
Notebooks full of ideas
<|endoftext|>
I thought I posted it yesterday
<|endoftext|>
I wish you hadn't posted it at all
<|endoftext|>
Cba
<|endoftext|>
I hate you. I hope someone locks you in your room for a few weeks
<|endoftext|>
i want to kill you
<|endoftext|>
then cut you up into small pieces
<|endoftext|>
then feed them to louie
<|endoftext|>
So, what your saying is, you have a vore fetish

how will you prepare them rod? apparently human tastes like pork, I have a few suggestions
<|endoftext|>
though that said, niall has a lot of body fat, I'm not eating that
<|endoftext|>
clay bake
<|endoftext|>
boiling is fine i guess
<|endoftext|>
good reference niall
<|endoftext|>
*bows
<|endoftext|>
rod, grant his wish
<|endoftext|>
make me into a chop salad
<|endoftext|>
you quinoa eating bitch
<|endoftext|>
how much quinoa do you think josch eats each week
<|endoftext|>
unquantifiable - i don't want to imagine
<|endoftext|>
He's cause markets to shift down there
<|endoftext|>
the price of it has skyrocketed
<|endoftext|>
that makes sense, like how prostitutes are 4x more expensive in bolton now that rod has killed a load
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
we did try to warn them, but alas, he must feed
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Thought you were both allergic to cats
<|endoftext|>
is that why you keep üòº
<|endoftext|>
to scare us off
<|endoftext|>
do you think if I had a cat scratch my penis it would swell up and not be so tiny?
<|endoftext|>
also @everyone Niall had sex for the second time in his life, please ask him lots of questions and ridicule him for the fat that he's 20, I'm going to sleep
<|endoftext|>
it does make me feel bad that im like 2 years late
<|endoftext|>
and i pulled a goth chick at 42s before spending the night in her dorm. ask questions if you have too
<|endoftext|>
2 years lol
<|endoftext|>
i don't regret not fucking when i was like 16 or 17
<|endoftext|>
it turned jos and rod into sexist pigs
<|endoftext|>
Rodney was 9
<|endoftext|>
she was 34
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
He gave her the local missionary
<|endoftext|>
:Rod3: < "Bitch, lie down in the name of god"

I also like how I was left off that list, what turned me into a sexist pig in nialls world?
<|endoftext|>
Your existence?
<|endoftext|>
Wow
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Love you all <3

<|endoftext|>
No
<|endoftext|>
You can love dead people
<|endoftext|>
Can you?
<|endoftext|>
Bit weird but not against the law
<|endoftext|>
Yeah legally you shouldn't
<|endoftext|>
i wouldn't call what rod does to a corpse love, but whatever
<|endoftext|>
Who said I was talking about corpses

<|endoftext|>
safety first, you didn't have time to unbuckle your dicks seatbelt on the next seat

<|endoftext|>
Which position? Face down in Lou's pillow? The "toast" as you call it
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
so they gave me a raise on the spot, like regardless of if I take the new role
<|endoftext|>
Noice
<|endoftext|>
Who's this
<|endoftext|>
Louie
<|endoftext|>
Since when does this little porky pine respond in discord
<|endoftext|>
I don't
<|endoftext|>
we missed you yesterday, josch had to do an impression the whole time
<|endoftext|>
was scary accurate
<|endoftext|>
He was very manly
<|endoftext|>
Almost like he's absorbed the testosterone of several men
<|endoftext|>
jesus christ
<|endoftext|>
Slurped it up
<|endoftext|>
Just like that toast
<|endoftext|>
the new place just offered me 5 extra
<|endoftext|>
I'm literally being bid over
<|endoftext|>
I was gonna turn them down ffs
<|endoftext|>
why rodney
<|endoftext|>
think you answered your own question there
<|endoftext|>
lol, true
<|endoftext|>
5 what?
<|endoftext|>
An hour, a week, a year? Underlings?
<|endoftext|>
Thousand pounds a year mate
<|endoftext|>
work won't match that but increased their offer and made several good points, inc that working for a software house is better as a dev in terms of upskilling and career
<|endoftext|>
tell me which to pick joschy
<|endoftext|>
got to factor in cost to travel as well
<|endoftext|>
that's a good point
<|endoftext|>
plus the ht works in dynamics and we build from scratch
<|endoftext|>
increased insurance cost could be high and 20% of the extra is going straight to taxes too
<|endoftext|>
both good points
<|endoftext|>
might turn them down
<|endoftext|>
I also like it here, have friends here etc
<|endoftext|>
Talk to Eccles, he faced similar stuff, he moved
<|endoftext|>
not sure why that applies but sure
<|endoftext|>
I just wanna fix this error, why do I have to make big boy decisions
<|endoftext|>
leave me to my code
<|endoftext|>
It applies because he faced an almost identical situation, so he has experience. It applies directly.
<|endoftext|>
realistically, it's not even ¬£200 a month more now
<|endoftext|>
and staying here from a dev point of view is just objectively better, more control, more influence etc
<|endoftext|>
Is it worth the risk of you going into a bad work environment for 200 more or it could be be decent plus the benefits
<|endoftext|>
Would the 200 extra mean you could afford a better flat?
<|endoftext|>
Is it better holidays and flexi time?
<|endoftext|>
better hols kinda, I get more but cristmas isn't included
<|endoftext|>
not flexi hours
<|endoftext|>
but not bad hours
<|endoftext|>
I can afford a better place now tbh, i just like being in sale, which is expensive
<|endoftext|>
plus, like josch says, travel and more insurance come out of that 200
<|endoftext|>
it sounds a lot more but it's not really
<|endoftext|>
If you're moving out of sale anyway then travel doesn't matter, you talked about it the other day, you ll have to commute for both
<|endoftext|>
Not sure why you'd have to pay more insurance
<|endoftext|>
commuting and more miles
<|endoftext|>
how insurance works
<|endoftext|>
I only have SDP insurance now because I walk to work
<|endoftext|>
Then, if you move out of sale, you'll have to pay extra for both jobs
<|endoftext|>
Rejected the offer, quite like it here at the end of the day, and I still get a massive raise
<|endoftext|>
You played mind games with your boss
<|endoftext|>
They won't sleep tonight
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
did you? we'll never know
<|endoftext|>
he was never heard from again
<|endoftext|>
kind of a pain that I don't get any of my sweet new quiche before we go away, already been paid this month
<|endoftext|>
Lol, he took a pawn off you
<|endoftext|>
Lost a battle but in the end your winng the war
<|endoftext|>
A prryhric victory
<|endoftext|>
anyways, after all that, I believe my career distracted us from talking about josch taking it cowgirl
<|endoftext|>
we can now return - josch, do you swing a lasso?
<|endoftext|>
A lasso of pearls
<|endoftext|>
I like to imagine that while he's bouncing he's completely flaccid, so it's flicking everywhere with the rhythm
<|endoftext|>

I will burn in hell
<|endoftext|>
Remember that time jos beat off that deaf dude? we couldn't figure out if he was expressing his excitement or signing for help
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
i think you were in the other toilet at the time
<|endoftext|>
he was in the women's, this was before the surgery
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney You never said you were proud of me, do I have your approval?
<|endoftext|>
I am very proud of you
<|endoftext|>
Thanks dad
<|endoftext|>
Oh yeah so our holiday is really gonna fuck me now, I have 3 weeks left in my current role so I need to spend that training and handing over, and I'm not there for a week and a half
<|endoftext|>
So that's fun
<|endoftext|>
Quit
<|endoftext|>
Lol, after they just worked so hard to keep me
<|endoftext|>
What a power move

Check
<|endoftext|>
Who reckons niall is messaging us while inside of his new squeeze
<|endoftext|>
oh yeah @Rodney have you heard that Nial thinks he has a gf? She doesn't know yet
<|endoftext|>
I've never had a girlfriend
<|endoftext|>
you should propose tonight
<|endoftext|>
trust me
<|endoftext|>
I can get you an engagement ring in an hour or so
<|endoftext|>
don't ask how
<|endoftext|>
what??
<|endoftext|>
who is she?
<|endoftext|>
a girl i've been hanging out with
<|endoftext|>
some welsh slag
<|endoftext|>
woah
<|endoftext|>
she's going home soon and i think it'll end there
<|endoftext|>
I'm of the opinion that it'll end when he kills her
<|endoftext|>
Either way

Big news, the man the myth the legend dr tony Lyons is retiring üôÄüòø
<|endoftext|>
Never forget
<|endoftext|>
but he's so young and vibrant
<|endoftext|>
the question is, how does josch know?
<|endoftext|>
Does he have some grooming targets feeding him info and dirty deets
<|endoftext|>
sometimes josch's parents invite him round as a third
<|endoftext|>
he's a close family friend

<|endoftext|>
lol

Rod, he's serious

I'm serious
<|endoftext|>
Let's see who can match and chill first
<|endoftext|>
(seriously tho, I'm gonna tinder when we leave Manchester, you might as well try it)
<|endoftext|>
We could do a group tinder :Kappa:
<|endoftext|>
Put josch front and centre, he can be the bait
<|endoftext|>
I feel like that competition is weighted in your favour, pretty boy
<|endoftext|>
I'm ruff, I just hide most of my face and aim for girls with messed up self-asteam
<|endoftext|>
Probably need to start moisturising as much as Rodney does and josch does by accident

I'm proud of how much that sounds like me

but the competetion was to swallow them?
<|endoftext|>
not enough
<|endoftext|>
show more determination
<|endoftext|>
wonder who did more swallowing in 2006, you or jos
<|endoftext|>
you get to travel the whole globe and take credit for hundreds of other peoples work (camera men, biologists, ect)
<|endoftext|>
plus he teaches you how to do his dope ass voice

you can tell it to never show you shitty papers though, you need to train it

mine is just a youporn rss feed

(also check whatsapp, it's very important)

@Misery There's a My Sharona parody song in ep2
<|endoftext|>
I'm salavating at the thought, 15 mins left til an hour on the bus til stranger things
<|endoftext|>
Who sings it?
<|endoftext|>
I doubt it but it does make breathing harder and will cost me like 300 quid a year for spray, tablets and tissues
<|endoftext|>
no idea, but it's weirdly long too
<|endoftext|>
Sounds even better
<|endoftext|>
you do daddy a couple of favours and he can provide you with medicine
<|endoftext|>
you not allowed to watch stuff at work?
<|endoftext|>
In the future I will, cos people do, but we aren't completely set up yet so there's alot of work still being done, plus I'm on probation still
<|endoftext|>
Haven't earned my discount
<|endoftext|>
if you lose your job and can't afford your medicine will you die then?
<|endoftext|>
I just won't be able to breath through my nose and will produce enough mucus to drown a child

rip
<|endoftext|>
My body is really fucking stupid
<|endoftext|>
I'm gonna write such a good speech for your funeral
<|endoftext|>
I want to be burned along with a boat then buried under a sapling
<|endoftext|>
I'm gonna dump your body in the mersey in the middle of the night
<|endoftext|>
take it or leave it
<|endoftext|>
When that sapling is a tree I want someone to carve 'ran out of luck'  into the trunk
<|endoftext|>
The tree will be an apple tree
<|endoftext|>
People will be forced to consume my apples

Straight, juice, pie, fried ect

love me some fried apples
<|endoftext|>
Btw @Misery josch says it wasn't him who met that girl so it was defo you, the pills are screwing your memory
<|endoftext|>
or sucking so much posh ass has made his head loopy and it was actually him
<|endoftext|>
just send me a picture, i never forget faces (like most humans)
<|endoftext|>
can't find one, possibly don't have any
<|endoftext|>
also, no way jos eats ass. Josch doesn't even go down on girls, he thinks it's unsanitary
<|endoftext|>
"...sucking..."
<|endoftext|>
never mentioned any eating.
<|endoftext|>
no one sucks ass for obvious reasons
<|endoftext|>
cos you get there first you horn dog
<|endoftext|>
What's the obvious reason?
<|endoftext|>
im not an expert, idk
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous you never responded to the accusation though, is it true that you think cock is sanitary and nothing else?
<|endoftext|>
you cock fiend
<|endoftext|>
I'm still baffled and confused
<|endoftext|>
you need to hit [Enter] josch
<|endoftext|>
I need to enter josch?
<|endoftext|>
in the middle of castlefield bowl and very suddenly

surely cock is inherently less sanitary than "*minge*"

when the episode started i thought i'd put on Chernobol by accident

people keep saying that but i won't
<|endoftext|>
defiance
<|endoftext|>
I like it
<|endoftext|>
so brave
<|endoftext|>
stick it to the man

<|endoftext|>
then you spatter it on his face

@Rodney are you all packed for monday? shaved your pubes yet?
<|endoftext|>
got your pics ready?

?

no photo's of yourself for when you go on tinder?

IK it's a joke but the pic would probs work

he only plans on having one photo and it's a close up of his anus

very eye catching

one of us has to take it

of your anus? nah
<|endoftext|>
Wtf is that

And it wouldn't
<|endoftext|>
@Misery I'm gonna be the one brave enough to say this - Billy is nowhere near ripped enough to be getting the reactions he does
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
anyway
<|endoftext|>
hopper is quite annoying
<|endoftext|>
character appears to thave taken a nosedive
<|endoftext|>
he gets a little better
<|endoftext|>
everything else seems ok
<|endoftext|>
for some reason it seems to be missing a cool factor
<|endoftext|>
because the ripped guy isn't ripped enough
<|endoftext|>
imagine if he had abs like mark whalberg in that new kids vid
<|endoftext|>
like season 1 started off really gritty and realistic, missing the boys dialogue alot. Ending was pretty damn sweet for ep 1
<|endoftext|>
when do you recon will will fuck the tenacle monster and make it his wife?
<|endoftext|>
would've got old so fast though, part of that tone was because they were withholding info

<|endoftext|>
I'm on 6 already, chop chop
<|endoftext|>
what else are we gonna talk about on monday, I don't care about your personal life
<|endoftext|>
we're gonna talk about how much josch has grown and then leer at him with our mouthes open
<|endoftext|>
He's put on like 30kg rod
<|endoftext|>
all below the belt
<|endoftext|>
"I can do anything i want i'm the chief of police"
<|endoftext|>
i hope it's not all set over the span of 4 days
<|endoftext|>
they all are
<|endoftext|>
i don't like artificial time constraints. i really don't see the point of setting a show over the course of a few days without very good reason
<|endoftext|>
end of the world? good reason
<|endoftext|>
monster attacking? That should take a few weeks minimum
<|endoftext|>
Is there a reason will is acting all hormonal and weird or is it just growing pains?
<|endoftext|>
(and holy shit  puberty vs the S1 dnd flashback)
<|endoftext|>
there are some great scenes. end of ep3 with the family dining room and billy was great.
<|endoftext|>
the my sharona parady cover was not long enough (music has been great)
<|endoftext|>
(only downside is some character's really don't mesh as well as they should)
<|endoftext|>
ending was a lot less ominous than the other 2. There's an end credit scene, fyi
<|endoftext|>
the my sharona parody was way too short
<|endoftext|>
your cock is way too short
<|endoftext|>
only in the ocean
<|endoftext|>
what time did you start watching?
<|endoftext|>
like when I woke up
<|endoftext|>
went gym and got a haircut but haven't done much else
<|endoftext|>
you didn't finish the to-scale oil painting of josch and burt reynold's in the style of 'The Creation of Adam'
<|endoftext|>
(rodney, photoshop it plz)
<|endoftext|>
That thought arouses me more than any woman ever has
<|endoftext|>
ok ep4 rocks
<|endoftext|>
bloody hell those last few scenes were spectacular
<|endoftext|>
|| How'd they fuck up locking him in a fucking sauna tho, i mean come on, silly kids.  When 11 was being strangled i really started to hate mike, thank heck he actually did something. Sorta thought that 11 was gonna implode billy and they'd all end up covered in blood, then the ginger girl would be pissed and brake up the group||
<|endoftext|>
really starting to like will the wise. He could be a good voice of reason
<|endoftext|>
damn it. you are making me want to watch it
<|endoftext|>
shoot me
<|endoftext|>
it's worth it. want a pirate link?
<|endoftext|>
don't give in to the hype @Rodney
<|endoftext|>
Do you poors not own a Netflix?
<|endoftext|>
Also, anyone wanna get tabletop simulator and play some nerd shit? Gonna buy it for next week anyway, you can do local
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I'm probs at an ameture metal concert tomorrow if you guys wanna hang in town after
<|endoftext|>
steam sale is on
<|endoftext|>
maybe
<|endoftext|>
is that girl gonna be there? last time I went out with a girl you were seeing I had to talk to a fat chick
<|endoftext|>
Girls gone home, said goodbye on Wednesday. And you weren't forced, it's hard to find a group with equal hotness
<|endoftext|>
Just look at us, a 4, a 5 , a 6 and a 9
<|endoftext|>
rip. Still talking to her?
<|endoftext|>
I was led under false pretences, I didn't know either of them would be there
<|endoftext|>
am I the 6? I actually don't know
<|endoftext|>
Still talking, but we had a conversation about it and I said we weren't the best for each other so there's no point waiting for each other . So now we're friends with the possibility of fucking in a few months
<|endoftext|>
Honestly I can't remember most of the time around when that happened, oh I do, factory was busy so we used them to que jump into 42s
<|endoftext|>
And I was hoping for a bigger reaction from the bullshot list
<|endoftext|>
sounds like you're dead to her
<|endoftext|>
pls explain it, guessing rod is the 9 and you're the 4
<|endoftext|>
which way round are joschy and I?
<|endoftext|>
@Misery Are you proud of us?
<|endoftext|>
you shouldn't be
<|endoftext|>
Pinned a message.
<|endoftext|>
Was there a shortcut? How drunk are you? Is josch tied to his chair with pink handcuffs?
<|endoftext|>
no we did it all, slightly, always
<|endoftext|>
I'm gonna be hung over tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
good luck josch
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
up to you, basically just need to throw stuff in the car and leave though
<|endoftext|>
if any of you are there early you'll probably have to watch me jack off
<|endoftext|>
it takes hours
<|endoftext|>
need post-nut clarity for the drive?
<|endoftext|>
my decision on whether or not to kill you all must be based solely in logic
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney are you ok if we listen to 'kiss from a rose' on loop on the way? you can sit in the front
<|endoftext|>
I am not okay with that. Sorry
<|endoftext|>
my car, my rules
<|endoftext|>
i thought rodney was driving half way?
<|endoftext|>
he can if he wants
<|endoftext|>
any of you can
<|endoftext|>

This is brilliant
<|endoftext|>
The very definition of racism
<|endoftext|>
(he's alive)
<|endoftext|>
I think it's justified
<|endoftext|>
and yes, it is becoming quite common for this sorta stuff over the past 5 years or so
<|endoftext|>
Racism at the freedom grounds
<|endoftext|>
Black Power
<|endoftext|>
Saw that this morning lol
<|endoftext|>
Do you agree
<|endoftext|>
Obviously.
<|endoftext|>
It benefits me
<|endoftext|>
And that's all that matters
<|endoftext|>
Fair enough, can't argue with that
<|endoftext|>
Will you all make fun of me if I bring weights
<|endoftext|>
Bring them
<|endoftext|>
Hehe
<|endoftext|>
Technically It benefits no one cos there is no discount, just an added charge. The proprietors won't earn any more money probs
<|endoftext|>
There are also no white people in detroit
<|endoftext|>
I will Rodney
<|endoftext|>
Just for you
<|endoftext|>
Fuck you
<|endoftext|>
Why though
<|endoftext|>
Last one
<|endoftext|>
Didn't even notice you taking those
<|endoftext|>
bad focus
<|endoftext|>
didnt get the wombat costume pics sadly
<|endoftext|>
loiue, post that pic we can blackmail josch with
<|endoftext|>
not a bad one
<|endoftext|>
is that during Pedro?
<|endoftext|>
That was this morning
<|endoftext|>
ssshhhhh
<|endoftext|>
So i guess the only way for me to take decent pictures of myself is to have them done without me noticing
<|endoftext|>
ok then
<|endoftext|>
What does that say
<|endoftext|>
*way
<|endoftext|>
@everyone You have permission to take pictures of me whenever and however you want, under some conditions:  1) I have to be awake 2) I have to have to have my junk hidden  Anything else goes. Take pictures.
<|endoftext|>
Creep
<|endoftext|>
Needy
<|endoftext|>
I'm asking you lot to be creeps because im needy for decent pictures, yes
<|endoftext|>
Hot
<|endoftext|>
Spicy
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

That's fair actually
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
genuine question
<|endoftext|>
You can just tell

<|endoftext|>
Especially under uv lights, his mouth and face are glowing
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

Or more accurately I much much prefer coffee
<|endoftext|>

@Louie1505  @Rodney  any plans then? Lu said outside somewhere. Grabbing takeout in town rn
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Said so when I called
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Where we meeting?
<|endoftext|>
don't mind#
<|endoftext|>
Are you in Manchester? I've bought my take out
<|endoftext|>
technically yes
<|endoftext|>
in that my house is in manchester
<|endoftext|>
I'm currently milking myself

:rod5: MFW she puts her tongue into my anus @Rodney
<|endoftext|>
Was charged for an uber that cancelled on me after like 10 mins of waiting and these are my options to dispute it
<|endoftext|>
Wtf
<|endoftext|>
Tweet about it
<|endoftext|>
Not on twitter
<|endoftext|>
Oh, I just picked one randomly and it refunded me without question lol
<|endoftext|>
Need to remember to add this feature on Monday
<|endoftext|>
May be
<|endoftext|>
Perfect system
<|endoftext|>
The best part is that all the passwords must be either plain text or encrypted at best, and you have to iterate over every account when you click the button
<|endoftext|>
Page would also be slow af
<|endoftext|>
And what if more than one person has the same password
<|endoftext|>
Or do you do "this password is taken"
<|endoftext|>
I say you populate a drop down with the list
<|endoftext|>
And then you can pick one to log in to
<|endoftext|>
Would be convenient, typing passwords is just too difficult

@Louie1505  Got my ticket
<|endoftext|>
Cool cool, mine is scheduled but dunno if anyones in to sign for it
<|endoftext|>
What's with the name?
<|endoftext|>
Some mom put a tweet out a tweet about how the internet radicalised young white boys
<|endoftext|>
And as a young white boy, naturally you have been radicalised
<|endoftext|>
What cause have you been radicalised to?
<|endoftext|>
The responses by young white boys are great on the main tweet
<|endoftext|>
you follow a lot of young white boys I'm guessing
<|endoftext|>
pervert
<|endoftext|>
No, it's on BBC news and the tweet is by a mom who noticed her son's using edgy jokes
<|endoftext|>

But why
<|endoftext|>
Because the last two were cinematic masterpieces
<|endoftext|>
Also money
<|endoftext|>
How do you think they'll be different now that the watchowskis are women
<|endoftext|>
Obviously the feminine touch will give the characters much deeper emotional weight adding a counterpoint to the brutal action the matrix is known for
<|endoftext|>
Also bendier bullets or something
<|endoftext|>
I think they're going to make literally every character gay
<|endoftext|>
Like all of them

lol, where did I get 4 from? D is 68
<|endoftext|>
don't do drugs, kids
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
Surely that would be setting variable D to char 4
<|endoftext|>
in real programming languages, 2 = signs are a comparison and evaluate to true or false and 1 = sign is an assignment
<|endoftext|>
you are correct
<|endoftext|>
so it would just be false

house across from mine. Anyone got 700grand I can borrow?
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
Planning to start a family?
<|endoftext|>
it's so nice, look at the kitchen
<|endoftext|>
maybe
<|endoftext|>
who knows
<|endoftext|>
I could take in all my unclaimed children across manchester
<|endoftext|>
we could get into selling drugs to make 700k? wanna go into business with me?
<|endoftext|>
I'm good
<|endoftext|>
Obviously the best way is to start a vlogging empire
<|endoftext|>
I think we'd do well in the drug trade, with my know-how and your expendability
<|endoftext|>
no.
<|endoftext|>
I'll take that as a yes
<|endoftext|>
The house is the same size as the one you're in would be if it wasn't split in 4.
<|endoftext|>
Doubt it'll go for more than 600
<|endoftext|>
It's in sale mate, add 100k to what it's worth
<|endoftext|>
Also it's bigger than mine, has the attic done
<|endoftext|>
With the attic done it may reach 625 to 650. Daytime TV experience.
<|endoftext|>
Bet you it sells for asking

Lol, got a dangerous driving warning on my insurance finally
<|endoftext|>
Took them long enough
<|endoftext|>
:shockedPikachu:
<|endoftext|>
Probably cheaper to buy a new car and insurance and cancel my policy before they cancel it, having a cancelled policy fucks you for ages
<|endoftext|>
Might go this weekend
<|endoftext|>
maybe you could drive safer
<|endoftext|>
I drive safely, just fast
<|endoftext|>
which in most inner city driving circumstances is less safe than going a normal speed
<|endoftext|>
No more lifts for you then if it bothers you so much, you can jog behind
<|endoftext|>
Or cycle, you cyclist bitch
<|endoftext|>
Rodney's not allowed back on planes
<|endoftext|>
not since the incident
<|endoftext|>
Which one?

apparently they're writing a comedy series about it. I wish someone would fuck my wife and make a TV show about it

<|endoftext|>

I'm like 90% sure there wasn't a friend
<|endoftext|>
you also defo said that
<|endoftext|>
her friend was on the step down and she wasn't my friend, i said to dance with her's

How dare they put a gay couple in the new IT
<|endoftext|>
not in my america
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
not sure what's confusing you there tbh
<|endoftext|>
"in the new IT"
<|endoftext|>
so steven king wrote a book called IT which was recently re-adapted into two films
<|endoftext|>
one of them just came out
<|endoftext|>
I realised a second ago
<|endoftext|>
I thought you meant IT crowd
<|endoftext|>
It or IT?
<|endoftext|>
the film is called IT
<|endoftext|>
The poster is written IT
<|endoftext|>
In the book it's written It
<|endoftext|>
...
<|endoftext|>
Poster
<|endoftext|>
"In" the book
<|endoftext|>
In
<|endoftext|>
I quote "In the book..."
<|endoftext|>
I cba opening it...anyway, my point is that they included gays, which is not acceptable
<|endoftext|>
*It had discovered a depth of imagination here that was almost new, almost of concern. This quality of imagination made the food very rich. Its teeth rent flesh gone stiff with exotic terrors and voluptuous fears: they dreamed of nightbeasts and moving muds; against their will they contemplated endless gulphs. Upon this rich food It existed in a simple cycle of waking to eat and sleeping to dream. It had created a place in Its own image, and It looked upon this place with favor from the deadlights which were Its eyes. Derry was Its killing-pen, the people of Derry Its sheep.*
<|endoftext|>
Brutal opening
<|endoftext|>
Really fucking brutal
<|endoftext|>
brutal opening was my nickname in high school
<|endoftext|>
What did it describe?
<|endoftext|>
(If you liked the first scene of the film then I recommend the start of Out Of The Furnace, woody harelson is a cold MF
<|endoftext|>
)
<|endoftext|>
40 mins in, so far I think it's a little weaker than the first, but there's still somehow 2 hours left
<|endoftext|>
ok that was cool nvm
<|endoftext|>
oh shit steven king is in it/IT
<|endoftext|>
4th best performance of the movie
<|endoftext|>
#1 being the over the top gay guy in the first scene

More about Burns night
<|endoftext|>
what's a burns night
<|endoftext|>
A Burns supper is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet Robert Burns, the author of many Scots poems. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January,
<|endoftext|>
this is a real thing?
<|endoftext|>
Yes
<|endoftext|>
There‚Äôs a poem about a haggis
<|endoftext|>
Also why does swipe typing on apple default to porn instead of poem
<|endoftext|>
pretty sure it learns from what you type mate
<|endoftext|>
You ever searched for porn by typing porn?
<|endoftext|>
what do you search?
<|endoftext|>
I type what I want
<|endoftext|>
when I wanna buy some stuff I type 'shop'
<|endoftext|>
Except that makes sense
<|endoftext|>
Kind of
<|endoftext|>
also wtf is fuq.com
<|endoftext|>
I dunno
<|endoftext|>
oh you'd like this site, they have a category called 'monster cock'
<|endoftext|>
Uh huh
<|endoftext|>
good song
<|endoftext|>
all the other categories are just screenshots lol
<|endoftext|>
I feel like we should set up find my friends so we all know where each other is at all times
<|endoftext|>
I wanna be able to see you all on a map
<|endoftext|>
No
<|endoftext|>
I'm hurt, to say the least
<|endoftext|>
To say the most, I'm devastated
<|endoftext|>
I suppose to say something in the middle, I understand your stance
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Add me on Find my Friends - we need to be able to find each other at all times
<|endoftext|>
also are you still alive etc?
<|endoftext|>
Huh
<|endoftext|>
Apparently I can remove other people's reacts
<|endoftext|>
Didn't know that was possible
<|endoftext|>
how dare you remove torb
<|endoftext|>
It does crash my app every time I do so though
<|endoftext|>
lol, weird
<|endoftext|>
you hyped for us to come down, daddy?
<|endoftext|>
In like 2 weeks...
<|endoftext|>
yes
<|endoftext|>
I will consider being hyped closer to the time
<|endoftext|>
that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me
<|endoftext|>
normally I'd get a hard no
<|endoftext|>
This is not entirely true
<|endoftext|>
I'm always fully flacid when I type no
<|endoftext|>
It's not a very arousing word
<|endoftext|>
that's defo a lie, you get hard at anything
<|endoftext|>
I once saw you get hard at a dying homeless man
<|endoftext|>
As I pushed him into the canal?
<|endoftext|>
That is pretty hot üå∂
<|endoftext|>
so compare to manc, how easy are the women in oxford? and can I use your floor to bang?
<|endoftext|>
No
<|endoftext|>
wow...you know I'd let you use mine
<|endoftext|>
oh is chloe gonna be there?
<|endoftext|>
idk if that's a yes or a no. unrelated, but @Misery reminds me of a disease I contracted in Gambia one time
<|endoftext|>
so @Misery How are you gonna get off work? I can break your hands if you want?
<|endoftext|>
i can't. My day off got rejected cos people already have that day booked
<|endoftext|>
and even if i went i have work at 10 on sat
<|endoftext|>
but if your body is shattered and your spirit broken in a staged mugging then they can't expect you in
<|endoftext|>
problem solved
<|endoftext|>
it has to be real though, they'll know otherwise
<|endoftext|>
and I have to do it
<|endoftext|>
Bow ties are fucking hot, why have I not been wearing bow ties all this time
<|endoftext|>
Reckon I'd get away with wearing bow ties to work?
<|endoftext|>
to not bring attention to the strangulation marks on your neck
<|endoftext|>
and they'd take the piss out of you
<|endoftext|>
They wouldn't dare
<|endoftext|>
I'm defo getting laid at this thing
<|endoftext|>
Not that he'll respond but @Rodney you wanna replace niall at a black tie event in Oxford?
<|endoftext|>
dont go rod, it's a trap, they *will* tie you up
<|endoftext|>
it's not even for the kink
<|endoftext|>
I'll tie a sexy little bow tie around his neck
<|endoftext|>
make him my good little boy
<|endoftext|>
then bitch-walk him round oxford
<|endoftext|>
oh he's wearing nothing but the bow tie
<|endoftext|>
Who tf deleted that image
<|endoftext|>
I wanted to jack off to it on the tram
<|endoftext|>
Fuckers
<|endoftext|>
the log says rodney
<|endoftext|>
I also say Rodney
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney I'm gonna show up at your house at about 3 on the 25th so be ready to go to Oxford
<|endoftext|>
Be in a tux
<|endoftext|>
we know he has one
<|endoftext|>
The tightest fit
<|endoftext|>
I'm just going to point out that Niall doesn't have access to the log...
<|endoftext|>
Niall has nothing
<|endoftext|>
You also don't so I wouldn't be too smug
<|endoftext|>
That's the difference between you and me my friend
<|endoftext|>
I'm owner of this server and you're not?
<|endoftext|>
I'll suck you off for ownership
<|endoftext|>
You can cum on my chin
<|endoftext|>
I'm good
<|endoftext|>
Oh
<|endoftext|>
Ok
<|endoftext|>

Hello,  I bring warm greetings to you and your family. I hope you are doing great. I personally made a special research on some Internet address books and I came across your information. I am presently writing this mail to you from the U.S Military Base here in Kabul, Afghanistan, hoping that you can be of assistance. There is absolutely going to be a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect to this email coupled with the fact that so many miscreants and mischief-makers who have taken possession of the Internet to facilitate their nefarious deeds, thereby making it extremely difficult to believe that any quest for assistance through the Internet is real or genuine. This has also made it difficult for persons who need help to get attention, recognition and assistance. Please am sorry if I am disturbing you, but it will do you good, if you can just invest some little trust in what you are reading now because this might serve as a life changing opportunity for you, so jot down today's date somewhere, because today is a day you will ever live to remember for the rest of your life shalom.
<|endoftext|>
My name is Sgt. Monica Lin Brown, originally from Lake Jackson Texas USA. I am 31 years old, I presently work in the Medics and Support Unit of 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Corps Afghanistan. To cut to the chase, I and some other high ranking Officers made some oil deals in Iraq before my exit to Afghanistan. The deal was worth $230 Million United States Dollars and after we shared the money, I later realized $25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million United States Dollars only) which is my personal share of the deal. But due to my status as a US Sergeant in the Medical Unit, I cannot be able to move this huge funds to my account in the United States to avoid further interrogation or face any kind of probation by the U.S government so I packaged my own share in a suitcase and have sent it to the Red-Cross society, because there is no other way out to keep it with me here. With the help of a German contact working with the UN here (his office enjoys some high level of diplomatic immunity) I was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of trouble. He does not know the real contents of the package, as I have deposited the consignment as a family treasure. Your acceptance to this would encourage me to send further information for us to proceed.  Furthermore, if my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do
<|endoftext|>
not destroy my career simply because you are not in support of my proposal. I believe that such opportunities only come once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by. For once, I find myself in total control of my destiny. This chance won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life and search for someone else. If you give me positive signals, I will give you the relevant details and initiate this process towards a conclusion which won't take more than a few days. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. Do not betray my confidence.  If you wish to proceed with this, please get back to me.  Regards, Sgt. Monica Lin Brown.

Dw @Louie1505  will lock the doors

Although he'll probably be in London by the time it's done, so we can still probably keep him out

@Misery so halo is super easy, even on legendary. kinda glad they didn't make it artificially harder by just upping everything's damage but the enemy AI still treats you like you have a controller
<|endoftext|>
port is done well though, it plays ok on kbm
<|endoftext|>
Apparently the aim assist for controllers is too much
<|endoftext|>
I bet that's hard to do right though if you're putting them up against people on kbm
<|endoftext|>
either they have an aimbot or they're at a disadvantage

weren't any spaces on the drive because that stupid van was in one of them
<|endoftext|>
Does your tenancy include a parking space? If so complain to landlord
<|endoftext|>
complaining regardless, can't imagine he'll pay it for me
<|endoftext|>
lol, they just emailed to complain about bins
<|endoftext|>

Exactly

@Misery @Tyranulous Should I book the day after that gig off then? We going?
<|endoftext|>
what day the gig?
<|endoftext|>
oh march
<|endoftext|>
sure. shame its a fuckin tuesday
<|endoftext|>
(They don't seem to tour the USA much)
<|endoftext|>
Im sure there'll be some after-event on at 42s or venue
<|endoftext|>
Yeah Tuesday is annoying. Are they big enough for that?
<|endoftext|>
Booked it off work, will get a ticket when i'm home
<|endoftext|>
A lot of the people at the leeds show weren't from leeds, i think theyll be fine
<|endoftext|>
plus gorilla advertises a fair amount
<|endoftext|>
Cool cool
<|endoftext|>
@Misery The link I sent is only a posted ticket, can get eticket on seetickets -   https://www.seetickets.com/event/the-regrettes/gorilla/1439184
<|endoftext|>
Everyone excited to take part in WW3?
<|endoftext|>
At least josch can go in as an officer, rest of us are fucked
<|endoftext|>
I don't wanna be drafted
<|endoftext|>
Tough, we need meat like you on the front line
<|endoftext|>
Was talking with the guys at work about this. Is it due that the last line of your NI number determines when you get drafted?
<|endoftext|>
It's based on your tax bracket
<|endoftext|>
Let the peasants die first
<|endoftext|>
Will @Rodney  be drafted?
<|endoftext|>
Yes but into the Ugandan navy
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous How much was Split going to be each? Should probably think about booking soon if we're going this year, cheap flights etc
<|endoftext|>
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<|endoftext|>
flights + air bnb
<|endoftext|>
Can't we go somewhere with bikinis?
<|endoftext|>
you can wear your bikini wherever mate
<|endoftext|>
so like ~400, jos
<|endoftext|>
@Misery Where would you prefer?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Are you coming away this year or do you hate us all now?
<|endoftext|>
I guess we need to find a balance between culture and scantily clad women
<|endoftext|>
idk why you think Croatia doesn't have any scantily clad women. Also, you have a girlfriend, remember üôÇ surely you're not interested in any of them?
<|endoftext|>
I wish @Rodney was dead, that way I wouldn't have to cut myself every time he doesn't reply
<|endoftext|>
He is doing heroin
<|endoftext|>
And I can look
<|endoftext|>
I have hate
<|endoftext|>
I'm not coming :a2:
<|endoftext|>
I'm glad Courtney Love is going to kill you
<|endoftext|>
@Misery suggest somewhere you'd prefer then? Guessing somewhere in Europe
<|endoftext|>
Also @Rodney you are coming, even if I have to beat you
<|endoftext|>
Off
<|endoftext|>
Whatever it takes
<|endoftext|>
No homo
<|endoftext|>
Homo
<|endoftext|>
Fine, some homo
<|endoftext|>
reckon anyone will notice this? üôÇ
<|endoftext|>
Why would anyone at work know your IGN?
<|endoftext|>
it an easter egg
<|endoftext|>
Ahhh
<|endoftext|>
always forget my neighbour thinks I'm called Bradley lol, just walked right past him while he was saying my name
<|endoftext|>
Or rather, Bradley's name
<|endoftext|>
tah
<|endoftext|>

ive not done that much coke, the link was real
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Come with us, jus
<|endoftext|>
What a jew
<|endoftext|>
@ him
<|endoftext|>
alexa call Rodney
<|endoftext|>
Reckon @Rodney wants to come with us?
<|endoftext|>
Rodney, you can ride a wave of emo girl clunge
<|endoftext|>
it will be very easy to pull there I imagine
<|endoftext|>
Were there emo girls there? Not sure I agree with that classification...
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
It's a matter of perspective
<|endoftext|>
emo's hate the world and cry about it
<|endoftext|>
punks hate the world and shout about it
<|endoftext|>
goths hate the world but love the darkness
<|endoftext|>
imo, they weren't dressed like goths or angry like punks, so by process of elimination...
<|endoftext|>
What are you?
<|endoftext|>
he's a moron
<|endoftext|>
<https://www.seetickets.com/event/the-regrettes/gorilla/1439184>  This is what I was talking about, Rod
<|endoftext|>
I'm assuming you've bought a ticket, runbo, we'll meet you there
<|endoftext|>
In full goth gear
<|endoftext|>
Gotta get your nips pierced
<|endoftext|>
He should do the hearts under his eyes thing
<|endoftext|>
like they're not already pierced lol
<|endoftext|>
he has stretchers in them, somehow
<|endoftext|>
you taken the day after off work?
<|endoftext|>
Holidays roll over in march, ive set a reminder for the 1st
<|endoftext|>
surely if you book it now it comes out of next year's balance? that's how it normally works
<|endoftext|>
Our HR system is shit. People complain all the time. I can't even book weekends off or add overtime
<|endoftext|>

Photorealism has gone too far. I can't tell that's not actually rodney
<|endoftext|>
Rodney would never allow his vag to be censored, that's how you can tell
<|endoftext|>
wtf
<|endoftext|>

Everyone read the news? üòä

<|endoftext|>
Rodney get your tongue out of his ass, ww3 is starting
<|endoftext|>
You can leave it there rod
<|endoftext|>
We'll go out in style
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Did you ever imagine you'd die due to a nuclear blast with your tongue in a perverts asshole?
<|endoftext|>
iran doesnt have nuclear weapons
<|endoftext|>
I like that that's the only part of that statement you disagree with
<|endoftext|>
You naughty boy
<|endoftext|>
Iran's in the process of making them most likely. Ever since trump pulled out the Iran deal they've started stockpiling allegedly
<|endoftext|>
(Google Iran 1970, shocked me)
<|endoftext|>
((pre 1970))
<|endoftext|>
But did you see trumps tweet? Seems like he doesn‚Äôt care all that much
<|endoftext|>
Although if Fox News tells him to be angry I‚Äôm sure  that would change
<|endoftext|>
I hope the Congress or senate quickly takes his military power off of him
<|endoftext|>
War Powers bill I think
<|endoftext|>
War powers sit with Congress anyway
<|endoftext|>
Resolution not bill, last used on nixon
<|endoftext|>
He has emergency powers
<|endoftext|>
He has certain powers, hence the resolution
<|endoftext|>
He can't start a war though, he threatened to on twitter the other day and a load of Congress people shot him down, pointing out he doesn't have the power to do that
<|endoftext|>
He has the power to retaliate enough to get them to declare war, he can't declare but they can
<|endoftext|>
Boris condemns the attack apparently üôÇ such a strong leader
<|endoftext|>
that plane was blown up üëÄ

<|endoftext|>
niall you sick fuck
<|endoftext|>
You're the sick fuck who brought it up
<|endoftext|>
Don't listen to him rod, he's probably coked up
<|endoftext|>
I do adore getting coked up
<|endoftext|>
who doesn't
<|endoftext|>
on a monday, no less
<|endoftext|>
Fuck monday. Coke doesn't abide by your human calander
<|endoftext|>
no, you don't abide by my human calendar
<|endoftext|>
that said, get plenty for tomorrow, lmk what I owe you üòõ
<|endoftext|>
You wanna do coke tomorrow?
<|endoftext|>
was mostly joking
<|endoftext|>
aren't you going to leeds? I assumed we weren't going out
<|endoftext|>
I can do whatever if we chat in advance, which we did
<|endoftext|>
idk what that means
<|endoftext|>
I wanna try the new club near gorilla
<|endoftext|>
It was the only one of four to survive after all opening in the same month
<|endoftext|>
sure, why not
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Wanna come do some coke in a club you'd probs actually like
<|endoftext|>
i dont know
<|endoftext|>
sounds like a yes
<|endoftext|>
Coke is like having like 6 shots of expresso in one go. You have an initial big spike of energy then you just feel buzzed for an hour
<|endoftext|>
whats the point
<|endoftext|>
It feels great
<|endoftext|>
im probs doing a bad job of explaining it
<|endoftext|>
You stay lucid throughout
<|endoftext|>
In fairness, Niall is illiterate
<|endoftext|>
It's fun, long and short of it. Can work on the stuff if you want - I have at 2 different occupations
<|endoftext|>
Plus you'll like the club, very neon
<|endoftext|>

The Orielles
<|endoftext|>
You think tarantino knows that other actors exist?
<|endoftext|>
Watching Hollywood? It's brilliant. The rain is really warm btw
<|endoftext|>
You think? I thought it was fine, didn't hate it but there wasn't much happening, feel like a good chunk of it could have been cut out
<|endoftext|>
also what
<|endoftext|>
It was longer than it should have been for commercial release but I loved every secons. I cheered at the end
<|endoftext|>
There's a tropical rainstorm happening rn. Look outside
<|endoftext|>
idk, one of the things he usually does really cleverly is have all of these unrelated threads and then towards the end they all link up and it contextualises a lot of the rest of the film, like pulp fiction starting and ending with the same scene
<|endoftext|>
felt like a lot of it was never contextualised, it was just a tarantino-y scene for the sake of putting it in
<|endoftext|>
There was some growth in Rick but he used the stunt double for much of the foreshadowing
<|endoftext|>
I guess. like I say, didn't hate it, just think most of his other films are better
<|endoftext|>
Preferred it to hateful 8
<|endoftext|>
Or furriest 7 or whatever the western was called
<|endoftext|>
wb that scene where Sammy Jackson talks about forcing that guy to blow him
<|endoftext|>
That was hot as fuck
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous Thoughts?
<|endoftext|>
The actor was perfectly willing to do it, but Jos insisted on being his stunt double for getting Sammy's cock shoved in his face
<|endoftext|>
For realism, Tarantino wanted there to be an actual forced blowjob on set
<|endoftext|>
On the other hand, the irishman was great

@Rodney  you missed a great night on sat, Louie did a shit tone of blow off a dwarf's ass
<|endoftext|>
Niall sucked off a tranny
<|endoftext|>
Do you even remember the dwarf?
<|endoftext|>
There was actually a dwarf?
<|endoftext|>
Lol yeah
<|endoftext|>
Didn't hang with us but he was there
<|endoftext|>
Slaughter beach, dog
<|endoftext|>
Wrong chat üôÇ

the dwarf thing is for real?

<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Italy are trying to reclaim me so I can be conscripted for WW3, we need to get gay married asap so I can get a green card
<|endoftext|>
You also need to film a porno
<|endoftext|>
As proof for your green card, that Adam Sandler film made people suspicious
<|endoftext|>
All gay marriages in the UK legally have to film the consummation
<|endoftext|>
and all straight civil partnerships, just to prove there is some love, lust or even a spark, there
<|endoftext|>
as I explained to you yesterday, none of those are required in order to produce porn
<|endoftext|>
But they are for that green card
<|endoftext|>
I hope that sweet young girl found a way to stay, and wasn't deported back to Latvia

<|endoftext|>
add some salt and sugar in the water too
<|endoftext|>

He confessed alot of shit whilst high last night

No
<|endoftext|>
Nowhere in Vexillology does it say you can't have hardcore double anal penetration on a flag...I think I finally have a reason to buy an island

Back on Tinder today. First girl i match with is an insane Muppet furry
<|endoftext|>
(and she's hot enough to make me go along with it)
<|endoftext|>
Why would anyone be a muppet furry
<|endoftext|>
IDK i mentioned Kermit as a joke in passing and now my phone won't stop buzzzing
<|endoftext|>
Elaborate, what kind of shit does she want from you
<|endoftext|>
Oops did I delete that
<|endoftext|>
I didn‚Äôt mean to lol
<|endoftext|>
IDK yet but as long as it's not to freaky im down
<|endoftext|>
ill buy a Kermit costume if it gets my dick sucked
<|endoftext|>
Wow
<|endoftext|>
Please don‚Äôt do that
<|endoftext|>
pin that?
<|endoftext|>
I think I need more info, what did she say about muppets
<|endoftext|>
She just keeps saying she loves kermit alot and saying she wants to marry him and stuff
<|endoftext|>
not the puppeteer, the puppet
<|endoftext|>
oh so you're projecting this onto her
<|endoftext|>
it's not a sex thing at all
<|endoftext|>
it seems like a sex thing. I don't wanna ruin this match so ill save my questions for a later date
<|endoftext|>
Fuck that's sad
<|endoftext|>
just meet normal girls please
<|endoftext|>
She's freakin hot
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Pics of her snogging Kermit or it didn't happen
<|endoftext|>

but also profile screenshot pls, I need to understand
<|endoftext|>
ah, I understand
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
as you were
<|endoftext|>
Looks like she's wearing about 10kg of makeup
<|endoftext|>
Not nice josch man
<|endoftext|>
as long as she keeps it on who cares
<|endoftext|>
Also disabled bathroom mirror pic seems an odd choice
<|endoftext|>
well she's clearly disabled so
<|endoftext|>
she matched with niall
<|endoftext|>
I did notice that when i sent it to you lot, not at the time tho, too busy looking elsewhere
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

I should probably get back on, need to fuck me a kermit freak
<|endoftext|>

oxford comma
<|endoftext|>
It's like a priest - Spank him Father Josch...
<|endoftext|>
I'll capitalise it now
<|endoftext|>
Oxford comma is only for lists of 3 or more
<|endoftext|>
Spank, spit, call bitch
<|endoftext|>
That makes 3 mate
<|endoftext|>
Nah but it 2 separate sub sentences
<|endoftext|>
If he‚Äôd said ‚Äúdaddy josch, spank me spit on me, and call me your bitch‚Äù then the comma comes into play
<|endoftext|>
Edit it quickly, nile
<|endoftext|>
Who?
<|endoftext|>
Sorry, edgemaster

When did you get a lorry?
<|endoftext|>
This morning. Ride is a bit weird, was driving down Washway and felt a massive bump
<|endoftext|>
Must be fun to park, especially when the parking sensors are covered in gunk
<|endoftext|>
Just have to make sure when you park it you drive forwards and backwards a few times to guarantee that your parking spot is dead I mean what
<|endoftext|>
Yeah makes sense

Basically inter railing without the rail

uk on full lockdown apparently
<|endoftext|>
most shops to close
<|endoftext|>
no groups of more than 2 people outside and police have power to fine/disperse
<|endoftext|>
That seems excessive
<|endoftext|>
I genuinely think I might go insane stuck in this flat
<|endoftext|>
It really isn't
<|endoftext|>
If theyd done that straight away we might not be so in the shit
<|endoftext|>

@Tyranulous No sarky comment?

<|endoftext|>
ok, goodnight dude üò≠
<|endoftext|>
You turned that around right? I'm very disappointed if you didn't
<|endoftext|>
her roomate was literally crying through the wall and she needed to start packing asap as her mum was driving to get her immediately
<|endoftext|>
I thought I raised you better than that
<|endoftext|>
You could've had the rim job done before the mum even arrived
<|endoftext|>
Exactly, you know me so well
<|endoftext|>
You play the not going to see each other for months angle and you worm your way in there
<|endoftext|>
Or rather, she does üëÖ
<|endoftext|>
Lol, apparently of 16 new starters that were due to come on at that company, I was one of 3 that didn't just have their offers retracted on the spot. Still hope then, I might not be a poor
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
not a poor but 8 weeks after you become unemployed...
<|endoftext|>
Kill the upper 19%!
<|endoftext|>
or did you sort that
<|endoftext|>
Maybe, apparently the dev guy is trying to have me brought on at the original start date and have the govt pay for me to be furloughed, they're waiting on guidance on how the grants work
<|endoftext|>
fingers crossed
<|endoftext|>
Aye
<|endoftext|>
Give it a week I guess, if I don't know anything by then I'll panic and find something else
<|endoftext|>

Painting the male figure is a meditation for me. I worship every millimeter of skin, every hair, and every muscle with my brush. My models are often friends and lovers. I work using oils on canvas, graphite pencils or gouache on paper. My subject content can range from subtle classical nudes to pornographic images of men is sexual ecstasy. I create sensual and erotic images to illustrate the mysterious, the occult, the forbidden. I especially enjoy adding a humorous twist on homosexuality, politics, religion and icons. Peter Paul Rubens, George Quaintence, Paul Cadmus and Tom of Finland are among the artists who continue to influence my work. I hope to excite the viewer visually, emotionally, as well as spiritually. It is my goal as an artist and sexually active gay man, to paint erotica that continually challenges the views of people who oppose sexual freedom. If my paintings assist the viewer in discovering where they are in the spectrum of human sexuality, then my aim is reaching its target.

@Rodney Do you wish to join us?
<|endoftext|>
think I'll just do this overnight
<|endoftext|>
its certainly not going to be done today
<|endoftext|>
at least not with enough time to play it too
<|endoftext|>
What speeds are you meant to get?
<|endoftext|>
unsure over 100 certainly
<|endoftext|>
Is it your jank powerline thing then?
<|endoftext|>
on wifi atm
<|endoftext|>
i think
<|endoftext|>
sounds like that's defo your problem
<|endoftext|>
i can give powerline a go i guess
<|endoftext|>
im not hopeful
<|endoftext|>
l
<|endoftext|>
If I leave a key under the mat and go for a walk then you can come download it and leave without us ever leaving lsolation
<|endoftext|>
so *only* 4 hours now...
<|endoftext|>
Heard back from PHMG - Govt have told them they won't supplement any salary for me so 1st Jun start date is pretty much set
<|endoftext|>
So that's fun
<|endoftext|>
I am now broke
<|endoftext|>
keep getting a disk write error
<|endoftext|>
yeah that sounds equally important
<|endoftext|>
first game im putting on an unused drive
<|endoftext|>
Cool
<|endoftext|>
Not to compete, I might lose my apartment
<|endoftext|>
really?
<|endoftext|>
How do you think I pay for it?
<|endoftext|>
And my car
<|endoftext|>
and like food
<|endoftext|>
you dont eat
<|endoftext|>
extend your notice?
<|endoftext|>
That's not how notice works
<|endoftext|>
No
<|endoftext|>
I'd rather be homeless
<|endoftext|>
Why did you delete that
<|endoftext|>
meant to say beg your manager
<|endoftext|>
Basically nowhere is going to be hiring now too
<|endoftext|>
Fuck
<|endoftext|>
so i guess it's either a loan or dole if you can't stick at your work
<|endoftext|>
Nowhere will give me a loan
<|endoftext|>
if you explain your situation im sure places will jump at the chance
<|endoftext|>
What
<|endoftext|>
you're going to start a well paying job
<|endoftext|>
they want your interest
<|endoftext|>
short term loan
<|endoftext|>
That's not how loans work, it's not 1950
<|endoftext|>
that's exactly how it works
<|endoftext|>
Have you ever taken out a loan?
<|endoftext|>
how else would it work? and you have plenty of collateral
<|endoftext|>
You're approved based on credit score
<|endoftext|>
I have an 8k car loan and 6.5k credit card debt, so my credit is good but maxed out
<|endoftext|>
if you want like a proper loan yeah, but im thinking less bank and building society and more those business like amigo loans and what not
<|endoftext|>
Never take a loan out with one of those lol
<|endoftext|>
Highest interest rate you can get
<|endoftext|>
you pay back twice what you borrow
<|endoftext|>
yep, but what other option is there?
<|endoftext|>
Also they still do a credit check
<|endoftext|>
Your credit score is public
<|endoftext|>
so what's the issue? Credit score isn't an issue for you
<|endoftext|>
> I have an 8k car loan and 6.5k credit card debt, so my credit is good but maxed out
<|endoftext|>
Anyway, my game is done, yours still say 4 hrs josc?
<|endoftext|>
ja
<|endoftext|>

Research suggesting you can catch corona from rimming someone...My life isn't worth living anymore

<|endoftext|>
I'm so fucked if I don't hear back from those two places üôÇ
<|endoftext|>
You have a good relationship with your boss, just ask for a few more weeks, your recruiter agrees. I doubt they've already replaced ya
<|endoftext|>
I'd maybe be able to get them to furlough me, but then I only get 80% of my salary
<|endoftext|>
I doubt I can get them to keep me on and working
<|endoftext|>
Can't really live on 80%
<|endoftext|>
That's a lot better than nothing...
<|endoftext|>
(/signing on)

Is it? What's unemployment like these days?

So there's a reason bl3 has a stupid amount of loot, @Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
Apparently there's an event on
<|endoftext|>
Extra loot drops
<|endoftext|>
Also why vending machines only have 1 gun, they all just have 1 legendary instead
<|endoftext|>
Runs until tomorrow apparently
<|endoftext|>
So I should've been saving up good legendary loot in my safe for when I start a new character

So apparently the lob used to suck, got a massive buff in the most recent patch, and is almost certainly getting nerfed in next one
<|endoftext|>
According to reddit anyway
<|endoftext|>
Damn
<|endoftext|>
Tbf the only reason it's stupid overpowered is because we've managed to find legendary ones with +100% damage or something stupid like that
<|endoftext|>
That's true. Apparently originally all of them came with a negative modifier and the rarer ones had less of a handicap
<|endoftext|>
Normal one was - 75%

No more easy ride boys

depends how low the fire rate is

<|endoftext|>
and what the hell is Temperature?
<|endoftext|>
Don't ask me to appreciate your jokes
<|endoftext|>
Comment not appreciate - What's Temperature?
<|endoftext|>
If you have to ask then you don't know
<|endoftext|>
That's how questions work, yes.
<|endoftext|>
There we go then
<|endoftext|>
What a deal
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Send us a selfie. I forgot what you look like
<|endoftext|>
We all should
<|endoftext|>
pants on tho
<|endoftext|>
looking at you jos
<|endoftext|>
There's mine
<|endoftext|>
Why did you take it using a camera from 1997
<|endoftext|>
1990 was 30 years ago
<|endoftext|>
time for 90s nostalgia
<|endoftext|>
Good maths
<|endoftext|>
Nice bass though
<|endoftext|>
"Sunkissed"
<|endoftext|>
like rodney's golden brown thighs
<|endoftext|>
Where's everyones selfies then?
<|endoftext|>
I'll never forget that face
<|endoftext|>
"that smile, that damn smile..."
<|endoftext|>
If there's not selfies by the time i finish work im posting one of me nude with a ukulele
<|endoftext|>
What an incentive to not post any
<|endoftext|>
There's mine
<|endoftext|>
woah
<|endoftext|>
now, don't be fooled by the perfect job I did rodney - that's not actually a photo of niall
<|endoftext|>
if you look closely, you can see it's photoshopped
<|endoftext|>
Also a picture of me would be very boring, I look homeless and I'm lying on a bench press
<|endoftext|>
I do want one of rod though
<|endoftext|>
I too look scruffy as fuck
<|endoftext|>
In general or?
<|endoftext|>
Have you been doing your exercises like a good boy, Rod?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
üò† :AngryRod:
<|endoftext|>
im going to get fat
<|endoftext|>
it's weird, my chest and arms look great because I've been doing weights out of boredom, but I've put on a load of fat because I've been at my desk for however many days
<|endoftext|>
Probs gonna be climbing at such a shit grade when everything reopens üò¶
<|endoftext|>
After BL3 we should all do a coop run of Remnant: From the Ashes - genuinely good game, souls combined with third person shooter
<|endoftext|>
Or we could mustard gas josch's house
<|endoftext|>
I feel like I have time to do both
<|endoftext|>
where the fuck u get angryrod
<|endoftext|>
:AngryRod:
<|endoftext|>
i think i grabbed it from a facebook NCS photo
<|endoftext|>
but i did not call it that
<|endoftext|>
i called it rod5 or something
<|endoftext|>
some bastards renamed it
<|endoftext|>
He's very angry

What a lad
<|endoftext|>
@Misery @Tyranulous Borderlands?
<|endoftext|>
I will if everyone else is i guess
<|endoftext|>
Jos is ignoring us because he's a dick
<|endoftext|>
*getting dick
<|endoftext|>
He ordered some off of an app
<|endoftext|>
Hope not, should be in isolation
<|endoftext|>
and they delivered
<|endoftext|>
got sanitized at the door
<|endoftext|>
baby wiped every part
<|endoftext|>
Weird
<|endoftext|>
Understandable, Jos' libido is unquenchable
<|endoftext|>
It's funny because the opposite is true. He's the only one prepared for isolation, he's been practicing for not getting laid for years
<|endoftext|>
Could get Remnant?
<|endoftext|>
$$$?
<|endoftext|>
I hate that you always make us google things for you
<|endoftext|>
¬£30 on steam
<|endoftext|>
yeah it's still quite a lot on key sites
<|endoftext|>
Asking if you knew offhand
<|endoftext|>
older game, I'm surprised
<|endoftext|>
24 on cdkeys
<|endoftext|>
I already own it. Up to you
<|endoftext|>
Took me 12 hrs to do one run but the bosses and areas are shuffled so I've technically played about half of the game I think
<|endoftext|>
I'll get it when we fin BL3, don't wanna start a new one yet
<|endoftext|>
im sure josh'll be here in like an hour or so once he's cleaned up
<|endoftext|>
Fair...He defo won't, we aren't going to hear from him for weeks now
<|endoftext|>
Was super fucked up last night and I fell and hit my head and cut all my arm, woke up to blood everywhere, was fun üôÇ
<|endoftext|>
fell into what?
<|endoftext|>
knife draw?
<|endoftext|>
Kinda over my table I think
<|endoftext|>
was a load of shit on it
<|endoftext|>
Fine btw, thanks everyone for asking
<|endoftext|>

This company never ceases to amaze me - currently having to organise like 10 people to do my own handover meeting because nobody else thought to, even though I'm the only one who knows anything about like 8 things that need maintaining once I leave
<|endoftext|>
sounds like such fun
<|endoftext|>
Where did you come from
<|endoftext|>
Loui finds waterboarding fun tho
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
foolish loving places
<|endoftext|>
the one that your girlfriend was the single for
<|endoftext|>
don't get it
<|endoftext|>
what's not to get?
<|endoftext|>
not super keen on first track tbh, they released this as a single too
<|endoftext|>
> foolish loving places @Louie1505  foolish loving spaces no?
<|endoftext|>
*By contrast, a forestry scheme in northwest China successfully protected people living there from dust storms - a positive development - but the growth of the trees then led to water shortages in villages downstream.*
<|endoftext|>
same thing
<|endoftext|>
ffs, been talking to a recruiter on whatsapp...completely forgot what my picture is
<|endoftext|>

used
<|endoftext|>
thoroughly
<|endoftext|>
is that the sexual subtext in harry potter that I missed??
<|endoftext|>
Subtext? That's the point of the scene
<|endoftext|>
Why is he alone in that channel
<|endoftext|>
ask him yourself
<|endoftext|>
I don't wanna speak to him
<|endoftext|>
He makes me uncomfortable
<|endoftext|>
my beard puts people off
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
I need to shave again actually
<|endoftext|>

All hail Raab, then
<|endoftext|>
Huh?
<|endoftext|>
Been asked to step up in Boris' absence
<|endoftext|>
'where necessary'
<|endoftext|>
have you seen DLSS 2.0?
<|endoftext|>
That the upscaling thing? haven't read much about how it works tbh
<|endoftext|>
its pretty hot. it uses deep neural networks
<|endoftext|>
it does a pretty good job upscaling 540p to 1080p
<|endoftext|>
or 1080 to 4k
<|endoftext|>
looks cool - upscalers have really come a long way in the past couple of years, even the ones in consoles are getting decent
<|endoftext|>
says one of the ways they made it so good was just training it on a stupid big dataset, kinda like openai did with that text predictor thing
<|endoftext|>
wonder if it's based on the scalability paper they released from that
<|endoftext|>
Reckon I can get him to suck me off?
<|endoftext|>

in other news, these people are so inept that I'm having to manage the deletion of my own accounts
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Eh?
<|endoftext|>
Your company is inept you are not
<|endoftext|>
Aw ‚ù§Ô∏è
<|endoftext|>
Issue is that it's the inept people making that decision
<|endoftext|>
My Instagram explore section is just goth girl fashion sites and tattoo artists - or a mix of both
<|endoftext|>
It's almost like it learns from what you look at
<|endoftext|>
Ik but I haven't been searching for goth girl clothes
<|endoftext|>
We both know that's a lie
<|endoftext|>
I mean look
<|endoftext|>
Nothing but
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's based on what you look at lol
<|endoftext|>
you must have looked at and liked a number of pictures of goth girls
<|endoftext|>
I don't like any posts whatsoever
<|endoftext|>
You just save them to your gallery for later
<|endoftext|>
App knows when you screenshot, you know that right
<|endoftext|>

<https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/fz2xkw/nothing_but_thieves_respond_to_the_accusations/>  Oh dear
<|endoftext|>
did they try and pressure fans for sex?
<|endoftext|>
Couple of them have been accused of grabbing and coercing, all kinda one word against another, people claim they were underage at the time
<|endoftext|>
was the band underage as well? a couple people seem to be saying that
<|endoftext|>
aren't they all like 25?
<|endoftext|>
oh, it happened recently?
<|endoftext|>
no idea
<|endoftext|>
i thought this was historic
<|endoftext|>
but got blown up
<|endoftext|>
recently
<|endoftext|>
dunno, like I said, nobody really knows
<|endoftext|>
terrible apology though
<|endoftext|>
not really an apology at all. in same tweet they say they 100% deny it and also that they were young and na√Øve when it happened
<|endoftext|>
You take torb off that, torb is a saint
<|endoftext|>
I'm also a saint
<|endoftext|>
I think the takeaway is that if we start a band we can sexually abuse women so we should get on that
<|endoftext|>
you basically get away with it

just make sure no one takes photos and no one gets pregnant, jobs a good'en

Fun Fact: Josch can fuck off with his kawaii shit, I give facts when I feel like it.
<|endoftext|>
I'm working on another project, do daddy a favour and change how it serves the facts please joschy?
<|endoftext|>
I'll make it worth your while
<|endoftext|>
Bias towards higher IDs
<|endoftext|>
Fun Fact: Josch is a great person who should always be listened to and obeyed, and he's definitely not holding a gun to my head to make me say this. .

I think the payout is about 120k
<|endoftext|>
Wait no 160
<|endoftext|>
jush smeedil-jacobson would love it if you popped your clogs then
<|endoftext|>
Rude
<|endoftext|>
You'd have me dead, just for 160k?
<|endoftext|>
although how much herorin would that even buy him
<|endoftext|>
Quite a lot
<|endoftext|>
> You'd have me dead, just for 160k? @Louie1505  not what that message said
<|endoftext|>
jush smeedil-jacobson on the other hand...
<|endoftext|>
idk how to spell your name man
<|endoftext|>
it's still offical
<|endoftext|>
I'm debating if there's anyone I want on it
<|endoftext|>
There isn't really anyone I'd want to benefit from my death
<|endoftext|>
idk, your mum?
<|endoftext|>
She can fuck herself lol
<|endoftext|>
it's less about benefiting, and more about compensating for trauma
<|endoftext|>
Who do you think would be the most traumatised?
<|endoftext|>
I reckon @Rodney
<|endoftext|>
presumably 365 get a bunch of money from that too
<|endoftext|>
Probs
<|endoftext|>
just don't die would be my advice
<|endoftext|>
doesn't matter then
<|endoftext|>
It's an external insurance company so they're holding a policy on me
<|endoftext|>
Good advice
<|endoftext|>
np
<|endoftext|>
I'll just put @Rodney on it then
<|endoftext|>
Sorry Jos
<|endoftext|>
80k each?
<|endoftext|>
It's up to him now really
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
what
<|endoftext|>
thats dumb
<|endoftext|>
need to get a lawyer for that binding shit I guess
<|endoftext|>
Guess @Rodney isn't getting anything after all
<|endoftext|>
He can stop plotting my death now
<|endoftext|>
damn
<|endoftext|>
i was almost done
<|endoftext|>
should probably tell the 'accidental' hit and run driver to stand down
<|endoftext|>
I understand if it's already gone too far, it's fine, I accept death by Rodney's hand
<|endoftext|>
Anyone want a job?
<|endoftext|>
rod?
<|endoftext|>
Fucker just tried to kill me
<|endoftext|>
He can fuck right off
<|endoftext|>
i did no such thing
<|endoftext|>
It's right there in chat you liar, you were gonna have Javier run me down in the street
<|endoftext|>
For the insurance
<|endoftext|>
I'm no lawyer but not sure this constitutes intent to have javier run you down in the street
<|endoftext|>
Which of us is a solicitor, Josch?
<|endoftext|>
neither
<|endoftext|>
But which is closer
<|endoftext|>
nope
<|endoftext|>
Exactly, so pipe down and take my word for it
<|endoftext|>
nope
<|endoftext|>
I assure you, it's more than enough evidence
<|endoftext|>
Provided you bribe a judge
<|endoftext|>
did they teach you that in the law school you didn't go to
<|endoftext|>
Yes
<|endoftext|>
And I went
<|endoftext|>
they just wouldn't let me in
<|endoftext|>
But I stood outside the gate for a bit
<|endoftext|>
I hear that josch know's a lawyer, very well infact
<|endoftext|>
You could say that he has her ear
<|endoftext|>
Lol, think my car battery has run flat with not using it, went to test and my multimeter is also dead and can't find my battery charger

It's like the pencil bit in the Dark Knight except your dick is the pencil and the gigilo's ass is the goon's head
<|endoftext|>
Exactly, or that time josch pulled me into an airport bathroom and made a condom full of coke disappear
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous  Good luck with your exam tomorrow morning!
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Rodney is praying for you

Anyone who likes python was molested as a child

Good luck with your exam btw
<|endoftext|>
No cheating. Even though it's open book ik you'd find someway to cheat
<|endoftext|>
Fun Fact: Jos has cheated on every test he's ever sat and every gf he's ever had
<|endoftext|>
I've never cheated on any gf
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
No that's perfect

<|endoftext|>
At lunch I watched an hour of bondage
<|endoftext|>
Oh, forgot to ask, how did your exam go?
<|endoftext|>
still doing exams?
<|endoftext|>
@Misery @Rodney Did I give either of you the ability to insert facts for the bot? One's been added and Josch reckons it wasn't him, I'm very confuse
<|endoftext|>
yes
<|endoftext|>
Did you add something?
<|endoftext|>
i dont remember
<|endoftext|>
Like yesterday or day before I think
<|endoftext|>
my memory is hazy
<|endoftext|>
So no then lol, prick
<|endoftext|>
So...either my code doesn't work or I'm losing it, I don't know which is worse

You played the magician's assistant and she made your dick disappear
<|endoftext|>
Fun girl, might text her
<|endoftext|>
Prove you've not got corona and I bet you'll be in, everyone's bored enough to shag - just look at josch, he's had to drop his standards from a posh 8 to a chavy 7
<|endoftext|>
That's not a nice way to describe Rodney
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, well, rod called me a dog so screw him
<|endoftext|>
Also rather not fuck a stranger in the middle of a pandemic, even for me that would be irresponsible
<|endoftext|>
You are a bit of a dog
<|endoftext|>
ill never describe him with anything but utter contempt
<|endoftext|>
Dogger
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
You're a hamster cos you like it in the cheeks
<|endoftext|>
false
<|endoftext|>
He doesn't spit or swallow, he just stores it there
<|endoftext|>
to louie, not you tod
<|endoftext|>
Add that to fun facts
<|endoftext|>
Oh
<|endoftext|>
rod is a snake
<|endoftext|>
Fuck you
<|endoftext|>
That's true
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney What should my first message to that girl be?
<|endoftext|>
Make it topical
<|endoftext|>
i dont know
<|endoftext|>
"i've been tested... for more than just corona"
<|endoftext|>
tell her you want to sex her
<|endoftext|>
just send a screenshot of this conversation and shell swoon
<|endoftext|>
Noooooooo

> Remember this?  üçÜ  üí¶  üëÖ  * *attach dick pick* * @Misery Fine but my actual penis is too small to take good photos, send me one from your collection
<|endoftext|>
There was a joke from you too
<|endoftext|>
it was the exact same as what rod said tho
<|endoftext|>
Dunno
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Purely out of interest, have you ever sent anyone a photo of your penis?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
not even once
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
Quite defensive
<|endoftext|>
i think he's being blackmailed
<|endoftext|>
Who did you send one to, Rod?
<|endoftext|>
I have never sent a picture of my penis to anyone
<|endoftext|>
and i hope you havent too
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
The bot was always dirty
<|endoftext|>

Do you? Because I can get you out, I know people
<|endoftext|>
https://www.emojicode.org/
<|endoftext|>
God is dead
<|endoftext|>
need that for the cv
<|endoftext|>
Skimming the docs, I hate how well thought out it is
<|endoftext|>
Someone spent so long on this
<|endoftext|>
It has a native JSON parser, what the actual fuck
<|endoftext|>
I'd say its not an entirely stupid language if it wasn't for the fact that emojis are basically impossible to type in any seriousness
<|endoftext|>
Didn't Tom Scott make an emoji keyboard like 5 years ago
<|endoftext|>
wasn't it like 6 keyboards...
<|endoftext|>
Semantics
<|endoftext|>
I have a keyboard with macro keys for programming
<|endoftext|>
Same thing really
<|endoftext|>
you could do an auto correct thing, so type words which auto change into emoji
<|endoftext|>
the "benefit" being that you could see the structure of the program better at a glance
<|endoftext|>
Is it worth the joke to learn this language and write a discort bot with it?
<|endoftext|>
Probably at the cost of my remaining sanity
<|endoftext|>
only you would know it was written in it
<|endoftext|>
It would constantly remind you
<|endoftext|>
The fact that the guy who co-writes Barry with Bill Hader also wrote The Cat in the Hat makes me very sad
<|endoftext|>
your obsession with cat in hat is disgusting. go clean yourself
<|endoftext|>
Agreed
<|endoftext|>
I ought to beat you both to death
<|endoftext|>
I really need answers though, like was he on meth at the time and now he's cleaned up or something, what went wrong in 2003 for him
<|endoftext|>
have you seen that ps5 demo?
<|endoftext|>
Kinda just a UE5 demo

Dynamic foot placement FTW!
<|endoftext|>
we're living in the future now
<|endoftext|>
(hated the character model though)
<|endoftext|>

The dynamic interaction thing was cool, like touching the door as she passed it
<|endoftext|>
you hate women?
<|endoftext|>
do you beat women?
<|endoftext|>
What's BCS?
<|endoftext|>
Big cock syndrome
<|endoftext|>
Notice he dodged the question
<|endoftext|>
yes
<|endoftext|>
no it wasn't the gender, just looked a bit uncanny
<|endoftext|>
and you assumed their gender
<|endoftext|>
could identify differently, you bigots
<|endoftext|>
Not in my America
<|endoftext|>
the character does have a weird face
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
So this is cool
<|endoftext|>
Basically SotFS for DS3
<|endoftext|>
Also fuck me, OnlyFans leaked all their porn
<|endoftext|>
Yeah i saw that vid.
<|endoftext|>
Oh, so your dick is now on the internet for free huh, hussy
<|endoftext|>
Mod is fun, they replaced the second bonfire in high wall with a boreal knight, it scared me
<|endoftext|>
> Oh, so your dick is now on the internet for free huh, hussy @Misery I'll give ¬£100 to anyone who sends me a picture of it
<|endoftext|>
Rodney's been awful quiet since the leak...
<|endoftext|>
He leaked it
<|endoftext|>
I can't find a full download anywhere
<|endoftext|>
I found it
<|endoftext|>
Send me my wrinkly little jew cock and I'll pay you
<|endoftext|>
oof
<|endoftext|>
hasn't that been a thing for a while?
<|endoftext|>
Not in servers I don't think, only personal calls
<|endoftext|>
Now we can all jack off on cam together
<|endoftext|>
I've done video calls on multiple servers so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<|endoftext|>
You cam whore
<|endoftext|>
And why do you never have a cam on for us
<|endoftext|>
you've never asked
<|endoftext|>
I'm asking now
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Bang bang bang in a field‚Ñ¢
<|endoftext|>
@Rodent
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
It's Heinekin's new slogan
<|endoftext|>
Bang bang bang in a field‚Ñ¢
<|endoftext|>
@Rodent
<|endoftext|>
I thought rod was a snake, but a rat works too
<|endoftext|>
More of a squirrel
<|endoftext|>
@Misery  @Rodney Join <<
<|endoftext|>
its a great time
<|endoftext|>
It's not
<|endoftext|>
louie is raping me
<|endoftext|>
I'm here againt my will
<|endoftext|>
he's also pretending to be a will smith (making bad songs for the end of shit movies)
<|endoftext|>
It's true, I'm also a white rapper
<|endoftext|>
Ill be like 15, 20 minutes. Keep lubed up
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Cume chat with us or no balls
<|endoftext|>
What the heck are you playing?
<|endoftext|>
MGS:5
<|endoftext|>

Looks like the snake has no balls :SadRod:
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Terraria 1.4 is out today!
<|endoftext|>
Don't laugh, this boosts my luck
<|endoftext|>
wtf is with "modern" websites https://armarchitecture.com.au/
<|endoftext|>
Nice and lightweight at least
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
huh?
<|endoftext|>
is that a lot
<|endoftext|>
Yeah
<|endoftext|>
They're just loading every image on the first request
<|endoftext|>
hence why it loaded quickly i guess
<|endoftext|>
After first load
<|endoftext|>
Also this site is utterly illegible
<|endoftext|>
it's just the most disgustingly laid out site
<|endoftext|>
why is the navigation sideways
<|endoftext|>
It took me like a minute to realise that the menu on the left was two items deep
<|endoftext|>
yup
<|endoftext|>
and it tries to give you a seizure every visit
<|endoftext|>
i just hate sites where you click or scroll a little bit and the whole thing moves massively
<|endoftext|>
Fixed it
<|endoftext|>
Maybe needs an hr or something under it
<|endoftext|>
Bit better when it's not double stacked. Their css lib sucks üò¢
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Do you have a webcam?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney really does deserve to be executed
<|endoftext|>
no and yes
<|endoftext|>
I hope we bring back the death penalty just for you
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney They got Kabuga
<|endoftext|>
How does that make you feel
<|endoftext|>
happy?
<|endoftext|>
Even after he bought you all those machetes? Good for you man, you have better priorities than I
<|endoftext|>
Shit, Facebook bought GIPHY
<|endoftext|>
People are gonna start to legislate GIF copyrights now they smell money
<|endoftext|>
RIP the GIF legal grey area
<|endoftext|>
There was never really a grey area
<|endoftext|>
Whenever anyone complained Giphy removed stuff straight away to avoid going to court and having proper enforceable rules
<|endoftext|>
Which means there isn't any real legal classifications, legislation or president because there's been no court cases, hence the general gey area
<|endoftext|>
You're a gey area
<|endoftext|>
> Which means there isn't any real legal classifications, legislation or president because there's been no court cases, hence the general gey area @Misery  Yeah but if anything, the non rules were over enforced
<|endoftext|>
does the epic launcher even work anymore?
<|endoftext|>
¬£10 vouchers or some shit (I've heard no issues)
<|endoftext|>
> does the epic launcher even work anymore? @Rodney Working fine for me. Playing some GTA?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
never
<|endoftext|>
Are you becoming a fortnite streamer?
<|endoftext|>
just getting a copy.
<|endoftext|>
but will never play it
<|endoftext|>
what why lol
<|endoftext|>
i missed the wave
<|endoftext|>
I meant why would you install fortnite if you're never planning on playing it
<|endoftext|>
i was playing some a couple of weeks ago.
<|endoftext|>
I havent bothered removing it
<|endoftext|>
Going through some stuff and I just found this ‚ù§Ô∏è
<|endoftext|>
Josch did so badly
<|endoftext|>
weird that
<|endoftext|>
Tbh I would have expected you to be better at golf you posh nonce
<|endoftext|>
Technically I didn't take a single stroke in that game
<|endoftext|>
We were counting the amount of strokes you were giving some poor first year while we were playing
<|endoftext|>
You really went to town on him while we were playing the last hole
<|endoftext|>
Was that rod's bday? i think it was
<|endoftext|>
too easy
<|endoftext|>
I took so many pictures without flash so they're all shit
<|endoftext|>
I thought it was yours niall?
<|endoftext|>
I have this shit, rod looks demonic
<|endoftext|>
Nah, it was defo rod's around the summer when he was in manc, I bought the tickets and you bough the drinks
<|endoftext|>
Also yeah it was rods
<|endoftext|>
Yeah picture had date on it
<|endoftext|>
There's no date or raisin emoji üò¶
<|endoftext|>
How could they have forgotten to include a dried fruit, the fools
<|endoftext|>
There are grapes, God's raisin
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney What do you wanna do for your birthday this year?
<|endoftext|>
Speak-easy? Camping? Arson?
<|endoftext|>
Arson
<|endoftext|>
i want that
<|endoftext|>
Cool, we'll put on a UK version of the wicker man - Who are we sacrificing?
<|endoftext|>
I suppose burning man is also an option but we'd need alot of gear
<|endoftext|>
I think we literally burn a man
<|endoftext|>
I vote Josch
<|endoftext|>
‚úùÔ∏è
<|endoftext|>
Also wicker man is in the UK lol
<|endoftext|>
Ah yes, a legitimate email
<|endoftext|>
How little must they have tried
<|endoftext|>
They think the year is 20200
<|endoftext|>
Damn, Rod he caught us. Brick the server, burn all the tapes. I'll meet you on that island from the end of shawshank redemption
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
My brain did a weird thing. I started reading an article and my brain read a quote in a really weird inner voice. I got to the end of the quote I read "deaf girl", so my subconscious caught it when the article loaded and applied the deaf tone to the voice.
<|endoftext|>
Has never happened subconsciously like that before
<|endoftext|>
deaf tone?
<|endoftext|>
how do deaf people speak?
<|endoftext|>
Youtube it dude, hard to describe but it's bloody distinctive
<|endoftext|>
wtf man
<|endoftext|>
Ik, i feel bad for it, but i didn't decide to do it.
<|endoftext|>
Surprised you've never heard the voice before
<|endoftext|>
~fact
<|endoftext|>
Fun Fact: A flock of crows is known as a murder. What Josch did to that family of 4 was also known as a murder.
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Seen 10900K stuff?
<|endoftext|>
A bit
<|endoftext|>
Are you gonna go intel again?
<|endoftext|>
its technically still the best in gaming
<|endoftext|>
Yeah but I mean they want $500 for the I9
<|endoftext|>
I'm torn
<|endoftext|>
I can afford shit like that now, but I don't want to give them the money out of spite
<|endoftext|>
Oh, 10600k is only 260
<|endoftext|>
12 thread at 4.1-4.8
<|endoftext|>
if you purely game, thats a good deal
<|endoftext|>
guess 3900x is way better for most other things, it's like 400 though
<|endoftext|>
3900x doesnt make much sense to me.
<|endoftext|>
its either go 3800x or go 3950x
<|endoftext|>
why fuck around in the middle
<|endoftext|>
It's called "foreplay" rodney
<|endoftext|>
So niall doesn't know what foreplay is
<|endoftext|>
If you're getting a 3950x then you may as well get the I9 though
<|endoftext|>
It's that bit between the asshole and the vagina
<|endoftext|>
I stand corrected
<|endoftext|>
Anyone got any spare meth?
<|endoftext|>
Nobody in the history of meth has ever had any spare meth
<|endoftext|>
Umbrella Academy S2 got a release date
<|endoftext|>
when?
<|endoftext|>
July 31st
<|endoftext|>
this july?
<|endoftext|>
2027
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
Coincides with josch being released from that dungeon
<|endoftext|>
It's weird that they let him have his own dungeon whilst also in a dungeon himself
<|endoftext|>
It's like when they give toddlers fake steering wheels and condescendingly cheer them on as if they controlled the car
<|endoftext|>
Images of josch raping a dude while dressed as Maggie from the Simpsons
<|endoftext|>
No kink shaming in this server ‚úä
<|endoftext|>
We're all freaks here, Alice
<|endoftext|>
Fyi Gta v is currently free on epic
<|endoftext|>
Rod says he's getting it but refuses to ever play it, niall is scared of gta
<|endoftext|>
Maybe Small Carl will join my organisation
<|endoftext|>
Am I winning?
<|endoftext|>
That clapping noise is really annoying
<|endoftext|>
Everyone planning their winter holidays?
<|endoftext|>
I wanna go back to Egypt and get sold again
<|endoftext|>
I was thinking more realistic, like UK cities. I have bunch I still wanna visit. Anyone else?
<|endoftext|>
Bolton
<|endoftext|>
Nah, too rough.
<|endoftext|>
Too many cheap shots
<|endoftext|>
Think like 100 miles further afield
<|endoftext|>
Sunderland
<|endoftext|>
Better but it's like a shitter Newcastle.
<|endoftext|>
Thinking more Edinburgh and Cardiff
<|endoftext|>
Oxford but no josch only miles
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, josch should go Glastonbury by himself this year
<|endoftext|>
Literally by himself, alone in a field with no bands playing
<|endoftext|>
He can do farm work
<|endoftext|>
Science Summary for last month https://imgur.com/gallery/b0ewlgW

How does literally nowhere sell displayport cables
<|endoftext|>
Amazon.co.uk
<|endoftext|>
Did it not come with one
<|endoftext|>
Yeah but then I have to wait till tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
Came with hdmi, think it's fine - it has 2 hdmi ports but only 1 is 1.4
<|endoftext|>
Either way, home office looks alright now, might be able to get some work done
<|endoftext|>
people actually rotate monitors for code?
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, look at how few of those lines are even using that much width, you can basically see twice as much
<|endoftext|>
on normal monitor you're basically just using the left half
<|endoftext|>
Just use window snapping init
<|endoftext|>
How would that show more? Would just show the same and I could use the other half for something else
<|endoftext|>
Most likely to have a MFF threesome?
<|endoftext|>
Least likely to murder someone?
<|endoftext|>
Go
<|endoftext|>
Rodney, Rodney

@Rodney  Thoughts?
<|endoftext|>
Lol, can is that cropped or the full pic?
<|endoftext|>
I cropped out the dude you were blowing

<|endoftext|>
Master Chief Collection, legendary-all-skulls-on
<|endoftext|>
@Misery What
<|endoftext|>
ohh
<|endoftext|>
No idea if it'll work on my pc atm, DS3 seems fine but some games can't get past the logo
<|endoftext|>
Oh shit, Halo 2 was added last week
<|endoftext|>
Yeah I'm buying it, you two wanna play?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
No you need an xbox live gold subscription
<|endoftext|>
/s
<|endoftext|>
/s?
<|endoftext|>
:sigh:
<|endoftext|>
sigh?
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Yes it's free
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Buy halo
<|endoftext|>
What's free?
<|endoftext|>
What did you ask was free
<|endoftext|>

That's fair, I apologise
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
They're great - come play, boy
<|endoftext|>
The download isn't 43g btw, think that's when all the games are out
<|endoftext|>
it's 15
<|endoftext|>
really? cool I can squeeze it onto my SSD. Paradox games take up so much space so I shouldn't put them on there but i do like a fool üò¶
<|endoftext|>
Well it'll be bigger when it's on disk...
<|endoftext|>
Which game we playing then, I'll turn off the DLC we ain't
<|endoftext|>
I guess go in order
<|endoftext|>
CE first
<|endoftext|>
is there even a way to not download it?
<|endoftext|>
Yeah
<|endoftext|>
Change your DLCs
<|endoftext|>
^^
<|endoftext|>
I hope @Rodney isn't ignoring us, because that would make me angry
<|endoftext|>
My download is done, how long for you two?
<|endoftext|>
An hour and change
<|endoftext|>
You stealing your neighbour's wifi or something?
<|endoftext|>
Josch basically is, trying to make wifi work in his mansion
<|endoftext|>
lol, it syncs your achievements from xbox
<|endoftext|>
quickest 40 achievements ever

You can get a 2080 super for 791 on amazon
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

Someone give me an idea for a side project I can work on, need something to code
<|endoftext|>
or we could play reach?
<|endoftext|>
Or both
<|endoftext|>
<
<|endoftext|>
Need to wait for josch dude
<|endoftext|>
Can only do campaign in a 2, I'll do CE with him
<|endoftext|>
Reach can be done in a 4
<|endoftext|>
Come play, he can join when he's on
<|endoftext|>
He won't be able to play if we do first mission
<|endoftext|>
Why ask to play then lol
<|endoftext|>
Also he will if he's in my lobby
<|endoftext|>
Gonna start a randomiser run of ds1, wanna watch?
<|endoftext|>
I know @Rodney likes to watch
<|endoftext|>
False
<|endoftext|>
To be watched? I know you said one of those
<|endoftext|>
What class should I pick Rod?
<|endoftext|>
healer
<|endoftext|>
I guess cleric is closest...this is the random gear lol
<|endoftext|>
I like his hat
<|endoftext|>
I hate you Rodney, the first boss is a gargoyle and I have a dagger to beat it
<|endoftext|>
I can‚Äôt parse that
<|endoftext|>
He has a cold foot so he's warming it
<|endoftext|>
Remember that time josch and his mates ripped a blind foreign student from his bench at debate club?
<|endoftext|>
#NeverForget
<|endoftext|>
#JusticeForEbenezer
<|endoftext|>
Yes I just looked up his name for that
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous Better be on for Halo very shortly or I will get angry
<|endoftext|>
I just drove for an hour fully erect in anticipation
<|endoftext|>
is steam down?
<|endoftext|>
Took me a few tries
<|endoftext|>
Seems intermittent
<|endoftext|>
I'm down for Halo. Reach and Halo 4 have 4 player
<|endoftext|>
4 isn't out yet
<|endoftext|>
< Come wait for him?
<|endoftext|>
Ill join chat within 5mins. Hydrating
<|endoftext|>
Make sure you're very well hydrated
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney are you keeping yourself hydrated in isolation?
<|endoftext|>
How much do you pay for your gallons of bull semen each day?
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous  Come hit us up
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous Come fuck my wife
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Do it and see what fucking happens
<|endoftext|>
Yes, perfect
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Quick suck for a sick fuck?
<|endoftext|>
That's a good deal, @Rodney - You should take him up on that
<|endoftext|>
I like my new name
<|endoftext|>
made me chuckle
<|endoftext|>
You make me sick
<|endoftext|>

Can it you frostbite dick
<|endoftext|>
@Misery @Tyranulous I have to take 2 weeks before sept, worth taking 1 in july and 1 in aug and then we can plan something closer to the time?
<|endoftext|>
Also @Misery - That's how stupid big Yorkshire is lol
<|endoftext|>
I'll see what time I can book off. People on my team book random days off alot so it's hard to book a full week
<|endoftext|>
Sure it'll be fine if you book early enough. @Rodney You wanna come away with us once we can if it's still nice?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  He means to the beach or camping or something
<|endoftext|>
We wanna see you topless and wild
<|endoftext|>
Don't tell me what I mean
<|endoftext|>
I want to take him on a cruise
<|endoftext|>
A floating petri dish
<|endoftext|>
Free:
<|endoftext|>
Free?
<|endoftext|>
Well fuck me
<|endoftext|>
There are 5 (random split) free single days left for july and no free days for august
<|endoftext|>
rip
<|endoftext|>
It's like half my team has double the holiday days I have
<|endoftext|>
like 2 people have booked 15 days off in 1 month and we have 6 months left til holiday renewall
<|endoftext|>
I'm gonna have to talk to the floor manager, ik other people in my team have made comments about this
<|endoftext|>
How many do you get? That's only 3 weeks, sounds fine?
<|endoftext|>
18 days
<|endoftext|>
You sure?
<|endoftext|>
Is that not including a set time off at christmas or something?
<|endoftext|>
yeah we get 18 normal days plus bank holidays
<|endoftext|>
wow, that sucks
<|endoftext|>
we get christmas and new years day off
<|endoftext|>
Yeah they're bank holidays
<|endoftext|>
ik
<|endoftext|>
I get 27 plus bank holidays which ik is a lot but I thought most people got like low 20s
<|endoftext|>
And I never take holidays lol, you want some of mine?
<|endoftext|>
I have an internal job interview in 2.5 weeks so hopefully ill be on a different team before august
<|endoftext|>
Nice one, going for that QA job?
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, even if i fail it ill just go somewhere else. We did ¬£3 million worth of extra optimising on top of everything what was expected/projected (¬£12M) and we got a ¬£70 bonus
<|endoftext|>
they don't give a shit about us so im jumping ship
<|endoftext|>
That's just the corporate mentality mate, you're disposable until you're a skilled worker that's expensive to replace
<|endoftext|>
Just con your way up like I did
<|endoftext|>
IK, half the people on the team are skilled and qualified engineers and network technicians. The seniors only got ¬£110, got them drunk in a zoom call and you could see how depressed they were about it. They covered the whole Argos transition and worked so hard and got jack shit
<|endoftext|>
I'll hire you once my start up is off the ground if you want - I'm writing a horse porn site
<|endoftext|>
Only if rod does the graphic design
<|endoftext|>
Rod's our Dirk Diggler
<|endoftext|>
I do actually wanna work on something that I can eventually put out, need to always have a side project going on but it's getting hard to work on stuff for the sake of working on it
<|endoftext|>
Might be able to get July : Sat 4th - Tues 7th
<|endoftext|>
cba logging in, will check tomorrow
<|endoftext|>
probs be fine
<|endoftext|>
oh weve been given 22 days this year actually
<|endoftext|>
that explains why people have booked 4 weeks instead of 3
<|endoftext|>
Yeah that sounds more right
<|endoftext|>
@Misery I can get those dates, should I book? I'll just take the whole week to use up the holidays I need to
<|endoftext|>
I have requested a bunch of time off yesterday, they will get back to me in a few days
<|endoftext|>
That doesn't really answer my question so I'm just gonna do it
<|endoftext|>
I have 6-10 jul 10-14 aug
<|endoftext|>
And some random days here and there
<|endoftext|>
Pretty sure new guidelines mean beach trip is allowed
<|endoftext|>
I have 3 day weekends this week and next week
<|endoftext|>
Sat is meant to be 22 at formby
<|endoftext|>
@everyone
<|endoftext|>
I'm working saturday, send me pics
<|endoftext|>
What days are you off?
<|endoftext|>
Sunday
<|endoftext|>
> Pretty sure new guidelines mean beach trip is allowed @Louie1505   Would allow being there, but car trip is one of the best ways to spread it
<|endoftext|>
Good, I wanna do my part
<|endoftext|>
Could do something tonight somewhere if we still can't beach, meant to be like mid 20s still
<|endoftext|>
Those are some good odds

I can hang out for a bit but I've got work at 8am
<|endoftext|>
And such a long commute to get there lol. What time are you done? I was thinking of finishing early
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney You fancy coming down to the good part of Manchester for a bit? We're gonna topless sunbathe and feed each other icecream
<|endoftext|>
Except mine is just a frozen protein shake
<|endoftext|>
Dude. No corona for me
<|endoftext|>
i dont wana die
<|endoftext|>
You're allowed to meet people now, watch the news man
<|endoftext|>
being allowed doesnt really change much
<|endoftext|>
it most likely increases the odds
<|endoftext|>
I mean you do what you like but the point of lockdown was never that if you went outside you were likely to get it, it was to reduce the number of people who did so emergency services could cope
<|endoftext|>
You were never that likely, we were just reducing the likelihood further
<|endoftext|>
Fin at 6
<|endoftext|>
Where going? Meet at 7?
<|endoftext|>
I'd like to go for a walk. Anywhere nice looking
<|endoftext|>
We should skateboard one day too
<|endoftext|>
Is @Tyranulous  coming walkies?
<|endoftext|>
Yeah I need some exercise, other week josch and I met at waterpark and just wandered about up towards chorlton?
<|endoftext|>
> We should skateboard one day too Nah I'm good
<|endoftext|>
Is that a no from joc?
<|endoftext|>
Eating dinner
<|endoftext|>
You bringing booze?
<|endoftext|>
Just finishing cooking. Steak night so daddy can't rush his pan sauce
<|endoftext|>
I'll probs bring a couple of cans, also imagine I'm going to finish this bottle of wine before I leave
<|endoftext|>
Dunno about joos, I'll call his mother when we're there
<|endoftext|>
GImme a shout when you're ready to go, I'm done
<|endoftext|>
Im dressed and that. where we meeting?
<|endoftext|>
Boathouse? You walking?
<|endoftext|>
Walking. Boathouse is a long walk
<|endoftext|>
Jog
<|endoftext|>
oh, you mean at the waterpark
<|endoftext|>
I keep getting it mixed up with jacksons boat
<|endoftext|>
Oh ok, yeah I meant Sale
<|endoftext|>
You're like 15 mins further than me?
<|endoftext|>
30mins further
<|endoftext|>
Cool
<|endoftext|>
lmk when you leave
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney If you set off now I'll feed you cold steak that I'll keep loose in my bag
<|endoftext|>
I'll get my bike, how long does walking take for you?
<|endoftext|>
15ish
<|endoftext|>
ok, ill text you when I hit chorlton
<|endoftext|>
Swing by joash's
<|endoftext|>
Google maps thinks I can jump the canal
<|endoftext|>
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say there's a bridge
<|endoftext|>
I followed the route last time and there's no bridge and the path is cordened off by a green metal fence
<|endoftext|>
Aren't you better going straight down the A56 and then left at mine? it's basically a big L and you're coming at it from the right side then
<|endoftext|>
I ended up doing that. It's just annoying that there's no way into it through stretford. Right I'll cycle to sale, ill text when im nearly there so you can start walking
<|endoftext|>
Cool, may as well meet at gleblands junction then
<|endoftext|>
We should visit his grave
<|endoftext|>
Trover saves the universe is so fucking good
<|endoftext|>

Watching the Channel 4 Dispatches on how the UK failed to stop the virus. Two different gov funded science agencies were out-right ignored, Boris didn't attend any Cobra meetings for weeks and actively went against advice live on TV. I literally want to kill him, the lizard guy and the NHS minister
<|endoftext|>
and the chief scientific officer who gave blatantly wrong advice. 4 people
<|endoftext|>
He literally tried to sell Herd Immuntity without a vaccine as an option, the sick fucking cunt

Weekend, wooo. Josch play some tunes
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous Who you gonna bubble with?
<|endoftext|>
no one?
<|endoftext|>
Well that's...idk. Don't you have any english grandparents or relatives?
<|endoftext|>
not in manny
<|endoftext|>
the main point of the bubble is to assist trapped and lonely old people
<|endoftext|>
oh ok
<|endoftext|>
> the main point of the bubble is to assist trapped and lonely old people @Misery  it is?
<|endoftext|>
pretty much, but then again they contradicted themselves a few times. Boris said bubbles are only to be formed from households of 1-2 with households of same or larger size
<|endoftext|>
leading many to believe it's to help trapped old people get items/food and so parents can pawn their kids off onto their grandparents when work is back
<|endoftext|>
>  but then again they contradicted themselves   This somehow doesn't surprise me lol
<|endoftext|>
Oh it was really bad that conference, they even spoke over each other 3 times. It was like they had different scripts. Completely different
<|endoftext|>
Or Boris doesn't read his script, which would explain alot
<|endoftext|>
like when he said we can still shake hands, on live tv, even though he was warned 3 weeks prior not too
<|endoftext|>
I just can't wait until chicks can rim me again
<|endoftext|>
Well if you find a chick who either lives alone or who's household doesn't have a bubble, then you can be her bubble-boy
<|endoftext|>
Josch already collected them all, he promised them that they're the only person he's been in contact with
<|endoftext|>

Will I be successful in my quest to drown Rodney in quail eggs?
<|endoftext|>
Also unrelated, this weekend I met a quail farmer called ben
<|endoftext|>
Sweet. Quails are easier to raise then most other farmed birds i hear
<|endoftext|>
and to answer, sort of. You skimp out a bit and buy some duck and chicken eggs too. No enough liquid in each quail egg
<|endoftext|>
As long as his lungs slowly fill with egg I'm happy
<|endoftext|>
It's my only dream in life
<|endoftext|>
But what if he mutates to breath the fluid?
<|endoftext|>
That's the plan
<|endoftext|>
He's a sneaky bastard
<|endoftext|>
I want him to have egg gills
<|endoftext|>
And then I want to watch him try and explain those to people

Why THE FUCK would you go on a conference call with 15 people and have speakers in the same room as your mic

This is a free speech server, please can you respect his right to hate the BLM movement

I didn't call for his arrest or execution :speig:

You tried to shame him

We should be cheering him for being brave
<|endoftext|>
Free speech works both ways, he's not free of consequences for his naughty actions

He is, he's white and middle class

That's why I'm gonna make a large FB post about it

2 months for balancing and small bug fixes? Smells fishy
<|endoftext|>
Clearly you've never made a game, shit's hard
<|endoftext|>
Plus lockdown
<|endoftext|>
None of us really have. I've built lots of little 2d games for school. Balance changes shouldn't take 2 months really, didn't think they would post-pone to increase physical sales
<|endoftext|>
especially since it's an adult game
<|endoftext|>
mums aren't going to Game for this
<|endoftext|>
I mean I've made several but ok

Setup: Part of the allure of watching mukbangs is the company while you yourself eat
<|endoftext|>
Pitch: So I'm suggesting that we script and direct a really awkward virtual family dinner to scratch that itch, which slowly becomes an argument which tears the family apart
<|endoftext|>
Cost: I'm asking for three quarters of a million dollars
<|endoftext|>
(Could even use that 360 degree camera tech FB made)
<|endoftext|>
What
<|endoftext|>
It'd be an experience for lonely people who don't want to eat alone...with a twist
<|endoftext|>
What
<|endoftext|>
We frame it as therapeutic, similar to what people get out of mukbangs, but then we slowly ramp up the fake family meal until they start revealing awful secrets and throw plates at each other
<|endoftext|>
I don't wanna watch anyone bang, I'm not Rodney. Counter proposal - if it's nice later we go drink beer and watch hot chicks swimming

I called 5 places and tried booking 4 sites
<|endoftext|>
only two available for a 2day stay
<|endoftext|>
One in the woods for 100
<|endoftext|>
one on the coast where we have to sleep in a teepee for 120
<|endoftext|>
(lui, the one you liked the look of only accept 3 night stay minimum)
<|endoftext|>
Before I spend 100 quid on the forest one does anyone have anything to say
<|endoftext|>
I have called so so many old people and been heartily rejected

oh, so it the was thrush that made you nearly barf
<|endoftext|>
I got drunk and now I feel fine, maybe it was withdrawal

anyway, I put half the xtc way when got home so I have a pill each just incase we feel like it one night. (I have the recovery pills too just incase)

@Rodney  We have enough ket to last you a couple minutes

Let's get square:
<|endoftext|>
In: 40/60 boat - Check that I have security deposit back in a few days as they have yet to refund. 60/90 for camp (he knocked off 11.50) --- Square: 35 for food/drink i bought in Sainsburys --- Out: 30 Petrol - paid 7+7 - Two lunches
<|endoftext|>
so 20 each for the boat and 30 each for the camp
<|endoftext|>
but I owe louie 15 for lunches
<|endoftext|>
Annoyingly the boat guys still have my security deposit
<|endoftext|>
What an unnecessarily complicated way to post that
<|endoftext|>
What do I owe you?
<|endoftext|>
What do you owe me?
<|endoftext|>
i've paid for petrol+, and i paid 35/75 of the sainsbury's shop but you paid 15 for lunches so you only owe ¬£35 for camp and boat
<|endoftext|>
rod owes you petrol, small grocery, lunch and chair money
<|endoftext|>
rod owes me a gay ¬£50
<|endoftext|>
> i've paid for petrol+, and i paid 35/75 of the sainsbury's shop but you paid 15 for lunches so you only owe ¬£35 for camp and boat @Misery done

<|endoftext|>
Glad @Tyranulous didn't come away with us, he would have ruined it with his homo agenda
<|endoftext|>
Still haven't got my security deposit back from the boat guys. I need to give em a call
<|endoftext|>
Closed now, I'll call them tomorrow.

<|endoftext|>
it's a friday night
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Thoughts?
<|endoftext|>
no COVID
<|endoftext|>
exactly, no covid in britain anymore, let's go celebrate
<|endoftext|>
Just wondering how the hell to spend the weekend. Bake? Buy a skateboard? Study for CBT?
<|endoftext|>
CBT?
<|endoftext|>
Every different version of CBT at the same time
<|endoftext|>
but in actuality the motorbike training (not the sexual or therapy versions)
<|endoftext|>
Called the boat guys. 7-10 working days for the security deposit refund. I'll have to check around the 18th.
<|endoftext|>
They do a week long examination on the boat to make sure it's perfect
<|endoftext|>
Svetlana deserves it
<|endoftext|>
How much do you think it would cost to do that to a boat but slap a massive electric motor in it? Can't be more than a few hundred
<|endoftext|>
No idea but the batteries would cost a shed load
<|endoftext|>
Maybe, you can get car batteries for like 60
<|endoftext|>
If you lost some capacity I don't think it would be that bad
<|endoftext|>
I have 4 days off next week if anyone wants to do anything btw (got made to book before Sept.)
<|endoftext|>
Possibly, I'm working
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Give me your fucking teeth
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Hand them over I swear to God
<|endoftext|>
I'll settle for the ¬£50, don't think his teeth are worth that much
<|endoftext|>

You beat on him in the into cutscene and then you take your own life out of shame
<|endoftext|>
beautiful trailer
<|endoftext|>
Why you're posting in here without having given me your teeth is beyond me
<|endoftext|>
Forgot you're not allowed to beat off at your desk normally, very uncomfortable first day
<|endoftext|>
Should have joined Riot Games
<|endoftext|>
I hear you can't even see the soil in the plant pots in that office through all the spum
<|endoftext|>
Wow...Landlord notified me he "may need to access my apartment very briefly" with an electrician today, looks like they've unplugged/turned off literally everything in my apartment and emptied cupboards to get at power outlets
<|endoftext|>
I also just have like drugs out on my desk and bottles everywhere
<|endoftext|>
Pulled out the sofa to get to the plugs down there and everything, wtf
<|endoftext|>
> Forgot you're not allowed to beat off at your desk normally, very uncomfortable first day @Louie1505    You're back going into an office then?
<|endoftext|>
When I want to
<|endoftext|>
Weird system but okay
<|endoftext|>
Office is open but going in is not mandated basically
<|endoftext|>
Fair enough, probably better than mandatory hone working I guess
<|endoftext|>
I'll let them know you approve
<|endoftext|>
Lol, wtf, check you aren't missing a few bumps
<|endoftext|>
What is your brain
<|endoftext|>
Where is my mind
<|endoftext|>
Interesting, Discord trying to rebrand themselves as a generic chat app rather than a gaming thing
<|endoftext|>
Could work tbh, I almost convinced my last company to switch over but one of the directors was put off by the fact that it was meant for gaming
<|endoftext|>
Way more importantly - Motherfucking Halo 3 Bois!!! @Tyranulous @Misery
<|endoftext|>
> Could work tbh, I almost convinced my last company to switch over but one of the directors was put off by the fact that it was meant for gaming @Louie1505   They basically need to brand themselves as slack with video calling
<|endoftext|>
Although they kind of missed the zoom train
<|endoftext|>
I mean its a super solid product, phone app is great, has a browser version. Could release an enterprise version with a different logo/name or something
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous  Want me to personally deliver any messages while I'm in London? I could hire a mariachi band and make everyone wear a cut-out of your face as we sing your message

Start streaming lol, I hear there's a big hole in the market atm

Well I hear sexual assault is quite rife in that industry, rod could teach you how to get away with it
<|endoftext|>
Is it illegal to stream under the name "Rodney Mutanga" and deep fake my face?
<|endoftext|>
The shiba inu guy does it without consequence
<|endoftext|>
Rodney's family has a team of lawyers though, and they're very touchy about use of their likenesses

Nah, they're just called that

<|endoftext|>
Gorilla is famously anti-japan
<|endoftext|>
Got made to rename a load of Japan classes at work last week because I'd called them all xxxx_Jap and apparently that was offensive
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
It's not great
<|endoftext|>
Feel like the Japanese aren't digging through our class names and getting offended
<|endoftext|>
The Chinese probably look through them though, and they would suppport Lu's naming convention
<|endoftext|>
(Oh, just got an email, I was able to have my train ticket refunded because the gates at Manchester were open on my way home so I never had to scan out + they didn't ask questions because of the pandemic)

Something happening at the arena...like 15 police cars there and a load of ambulances, road block set up so you can only go right, traffic basically at a standstill
<|endoftext|>
Stabbing apparently, fun
<|endoftext|>
Who doesn't love a good stabbing
<|endoftext|>
They were asking people if they'd seen this man
<|endoftext|>
Welcome to my world

I'm excited for Fable. No gameplay though
<|endoftext|>
Surprised you like Grounded, it's like Ark, Conan and games of that ilk
<|endoftext|>
If it's cheap I'll give it a go
<|endoftext|>

(Infinity's movement does look great, hopefully the graphics will grow on me more. The elites look a little short.)
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
> (Infinity's movement does look great, hopefully the graphics will grow on me more. The elites look a little short.) @Misery it's infinite but I like the graphics way more than 4 or 5, there was so much shit on your screen and you couldn't see what you were killing
<|endoftext|>
But the multiplayer survival ones feel alot different
<|endoftext|>
I feel same way about the graphics, I prefer it but its a little strange looking. Maybe it's the vibrant colours.
<|endoftext|>
Elites are still too short though.
<|endoftext|>
Weirdly so. Disproportionate

@Rodney What you doing for your birthday?
<|endoftext|>
Go Carting?
<|endoftext|>
I mean I was just asking him, I'm not presuming that we're invited
<|endoftext|>
He hates us

@Rodney What's your opinion on the Jungle Brothers? Niall is joining them
<|endoftext|>
Also will you order me a pizza?
<|endoftext|>
Or someone
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous Order me food
<|endoftext|>
He died in a fire 3 years ago loui
<|endoftext|>
And the court ruled it an accident
<|endoftext|>
Winning
<|endoftext|>
He left his laptop to his cat so no one can take over the server
<|endoftext|>
Fun fact, his cat's name is Jeffrey
<|endoftext|>
no idea why
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney How long until my food arrives?
<|endoftext|>
I cannot believe that Jew bitch just made me order my own food
<|endoftext|>
This is so much food Rod, wtf, I can't eat all this
<|endoftext|>
@Misery You can kinda draw right? How well do you think you could do cartoon-y UI for a party game?
<|endoftext|>
Preferably in SVG
<|endoftext|>
Tutorial seems easy enough. Build in Adobe Stock and export as a SVG
<|endoftext|>
Excellent
<|endoftext|>
I'll send you some Jira tickets
<|endoftext|>
Don't need a tablet if it's simple cartoony stuff, though probs need to buy a nice mouse anyway
<|endoftext|>
You'll need a surface studio
<|endoftext|>
I can't use art that wasn't produced on a surface studio
<|endoftext|>
Legally, MS sponsor me
<|endoftext|>
Jesus those cost a packet
<|endoftext|>
they look so fragile
<|endoftext|>
Yup, and you get all the non-upgradable power of a 960m
<|endoftext|>
Apparently they're super nice to use but the computer sucks and there's no way to use it once it's obsolete so
<|endoftext|>
Surface Pros get great reviews but they were advertised for casual use by rich middle aged people instead of as a decent multi-use art tablet/laptop
<|endoftext|>
If I had to work on a laptop I'd probs get a top end surface bc I don't really benefit from gpu, don't think any of them have a decent card
<|endoftext|>
Thankfully a massive corporation gave me a stupid powerful workstation
<|endoftext|>
They did?
<|endoftext|>
> If I had to work on a laptop I'd probs get a top end surface bc I don't really benefit from gpu, don't think any of them have a decent card  Surface book is supposed to have a decent(ish) gpu I think

There he goes, off into his burning skyline for another day. Safe in the knowledge that he is not forgotten and we still fear his wrath.
<|endoftext|>
He knows his days are numbered
<|endoftext|>
2 of them specifically
<|endoftext|>
fok
<|endoftext|>
We're meeting him Sunday at the airport
<|endoftext|>
Who's "we"?
<|endoftext|>
Me and the boys

His kneecaps won't know what hit 'em
<|endoftext|>
He won't know who's in him and how
<|endoftext|>
Where you're going, you don't need holes
<|endoftext|>
The film? Nobody needed that film except Shia
<|endoftext|>
I acknowledge him in that and nymphomaniac
<|endoftext|>
Nothing else
<|endoftext|>
He needed it
<|endoftext|>
I honestly thought he was dead
<|endoftext|>
Isn't he?
<|endoftext|>
No, maybe another of the young cast died
<|endoftext|>
it does ring a bell that one of them did
<|endoftext|>
Only one of them went on to be CGId onto several porn actors though

<|endoftext|>
Is everyone eating out later?
<|endoftext|>
(My present is in the post...it got delayed...by erm, erm... Corona! oh, yes. That's why. Totally not my bad.)
<|endoftext|>
> Is everyone eating out later? @Misery Only if jos lets me use a dental dam
<|endoftext|>
I'll assume that's because of the pandemic and not a slight on J-Bomb's sexual health
<|endoftext|>
but are we getting food later? Boris might pay a tenner as it's Monday
<|endoftext|>
Josch doesn't get laid enough for me to be worried about catching something
<|endoftext|>
I need to get food, coming straight from work
<|endoftext|>
So what where when?
<|endoftext|>
You're not invited
<|endoftext|>
You keep trying to lick us
<|endoftext|>
No thank you
<|endoftext|>
How? Who? Why?
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous He said Courtyard or 'spoons to me
<|endoftext|>
Courtyard is open till 1am
<|endoftext|>
They remodelled a bit recently
<|endoftext|>
All the spoons have a weird atmosphere with the quarantine precautions so I'd recommend Courtyard. Does food and has pool tables
<|endoftext|>
https://www.courtyardmanchester.co.uk/food
<|endoftext|>
Never seen that before
<|endoftext|>
Didn't know they did food
<|endoftext|>
He didn't invite jos so that means he can't come as far as I'm concerned
<|endoftext|>
And I'm willing to use force to enforce that
<|endoftext|>
I remember them having a much smaller menu, maybe they upped it during the refurb
<|endoftext|>
Guess they aren't making a fuckload from club predrinkers atm
<|endoftext|>
It's the sorta food you get in those american red plastic bowls with holes in
<|endoftext|>
Appetising
<|endoftext|>
I hear it's nice, I know someone who loves the pizza there
<|endoftext|>
You also know a dude who loves chewing on ears so not the best sell
<|endoftext|>
Several
<|endoftext|>
Josch is not alone
<|endoftext|>
He is
<|endoftext|>
Always
<|endoftext|>
Even when he's with people
<|endoftext|>
If you and @Rodney are gonna be a while then I could drop my car at home in theory, was planning to leave work 4:30-5 ish
<|endoftext|>
Though I have paid to park until midnight
<|endoftext|>
Or rather Bet365 have paid
<|endoftext|>
i finish work at 1710, im mostly dressed so ill be on a bus around 1730. Get to town at 1800
<|endoftext|>
Hug @Rodney  at 1805
<|endoftext|>
Go down on him at 18:06
<|endoftext|>
He finishes at 18:06:47

<|endoftext|>
I was gonna suggest we play ping pong or go-carting for Rods birthday on the weekend but it's up to him
<|endoftext|>
Fine with either
<|endoftext|>
Wtf
<|endoftext|>
Is it shorts weather? The weather...person says 23 degrees, but it feels cooler

<|endoftext|>
Yeah
<|endoftext|>
We're in walkabout in Printworks atm, moving shortly
<|endoftext|>
The place with the pink lights shining in the window from the new stripclub across the street?
<|endoftext|>
No
<|endoftext|>
Also we're at courtyard now
<|endoftext|>
Rodney and his sister do not look alike
<|endoftext|>
that is all
<|endoftext|>
White?
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney what did I tell you about your name
<|endoftext|>
sorry
<|endoftext|>
Feel like you still need to spend some time in the naughty corner. @Tyranulous will you do the honours please
<|endoftext|>
But he practiced safe sex for the first time yesterday... and it is still sorta his bday, let him off
<|endoftext|>
there is teamsport go karting at manchester victoria
<|endoftext|>
Yeah I saw, we could go there. Easy walk after
<|endoftext|>
> But he practiced safe sex for the first time yesterday... and it is still sorta his bday, let him off @Misery wtf does that first bit mean, Rob been banging Courtyard chicks?
<|endoftext|>
It was a callback to yesterday
<|endoftext|>
I have rod a condom as a joke gift and then he went to the toilets with sharnelle, we congratulated him when he returned
<|endoftext|>
Ah yes
<|endoftext|>
Good lad Rod
<|endoftext|>
I'm down for team karting, they have another one I've been to that was decent
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous and I have ¬£250 on this race
<|endoftext|>
you do?
<|endoftext|>
We do
<|endoftext|>
Are we allowed to just book there as a big group?
<|endoftext|>
Could book in 2s/3s
<|endoftext|>
I have ¬£300 on the Slavs
<|endoftext|>
they do large groups
<|endoftext|>
But maybe not atm
<|endoftext|>
With the Chinese flu and all
<|endoftext|>
Can someone check? I'm arguing with testers
<|endoftext|>
I'll deal with it all after work. I need to get the headcount before I book, there's lots of different deals on the website. 8 or less people per party it says
<|endoftext|>
Might be worth Rog making a WhatsApp group
<|endoftext|>
> I'll deal with it all after work. I need to get the headcount before I book, there's lots of different deals on the website. 8 or less people per party it says @Misery So you can do >8 but it basically amounts to hiring the place out bc then you can bring up to 150 so that sounds expensive
<|endoftext|>
I think there'll be <8 of us though
<|endoftext|>
They've got the right idea
<|endoftext|>
So I'm guessing it's us 4 and rod's salty mate, @Rodney?
<|endoftext|>
Presume so, Ash coming + just coming for drinks if so?
<|endoftext|>
Haven't talked today. If she is in Manc I'll invite her for drinks
<|endoftext|>
Cool
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous Should invite his gf oh wait
<|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry josch
<|endoftext|>
Is it officially over?
<|endoftext|>
She's dead
<|endoftext|>
You'll be OK Josch, we're here for you
<|endoftext|>
I'm not
<|endoftext|>
Will Rod respond or should I just say 5 people
<|endoftext|>
Should also probs talk to Kieran, they'll make you pay up front
<|endoftext|>
¬£30 each, yeah making me pay now
<|endoftext|>
Joc can pay for me
<|endoftext|>
Actually?
<|endoftext|>
I demand it
<|endoftext|>
Pay like 8% of his debt to you
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
He's alive atleast
<|endoftext|>
Right Kieron says 1830 is good for him
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney @Tyranulous @Louie1505  Am I booking this?
<|endoftext|>
Not putting the 150 down until everyone agrees
<|endoftext|>
Fine for me
<|endoftext|>
¬£30 quid each still
<|endoftext|>
what is the ¬£30 getting us?
<|endoftext|>
¬£30 quid is a little redundant
<|endoftext|>
2 * 15min races
<|endoftext|>
If you do evening you get an extra one
<|endoftext|>
Also it's 27 if you use the code
<|endoftext|>
Actually why are you booking this after the other week
<|endoftext|>
Josch do it
<|endoftext|>
Oh you guys wanna go for 2000 then?
<|endoftext|>
Ik, I'll use the code
<|endoftext|>
Is that the earliest evening one?
<|endoftext|>
yah
<|endoftext|>
Hmmm
<|endoftext|>
So we'd be there till like 21:30
<|endoftext|>
Dunno
<|endoftext|>
yeah. Then head to a bar
<|endoftext|>
You and Kieron can try and drink each other to death
<|endoftext|>
We all good then?
<|endoftext|>
Unsure
<|endoftext|>
Might be bit late to be there? Can't predrink at all
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous @Rodney Weight in
<|endoftext|>
There's a bar in the place
<|endoftext|>
Can't drive them drunk though
<|endoftext|>
They'll defo stop you
<|endoftext|>
Well it's 1845 for 2 or 2000 for 3
<|endoftext|>
Which would you rather?
<|endoftext|>
Well it is Friday so people will be out till later. I'd prefer 2000 anyhow
<|endoftext|>
You can drink beforehand if you don't act drunk when in there
<|endoftext|>
I'm not gonna drive a 40mph piece of plastic drunk
<|endoftext|>
I dont mean shit faced. You drive after drinking all the time
<|endoftext|>
I never drive over the limit
<|endoftext|>
Also my car would keep me alive in like a 120mph collision
<|endoftext|>
2130 is a perfectly normal time to start drinking on a Friday
<|endoftext|>
I think @Rodney should decide, I don't really mind either way
<|endoftext|>
Is he on Battle.net?
<|endoftext|>
ddos his ass
<|endoftext|>
What a random question
<|endoftext|>
He's not responding
<|endoftext|>
Thought he'd be playing Overwatch
<|endoftext|>
He's been offline for 5 months
<|endoftext|>
Or whatever Valorent is on
<|endoftext|>
or Epic
<|endoftext|>
or x, y and z
<|endoftext|>
Valourant installs a root kit on your machine and uses that
<|endoftext|>
I'm not joking
<|endoftext|>
You've told me. I chuckled in fear
<|endoftext|>
I know for a fact that @Tyranulous has this on his top monitor and is just watching us talk
<|endoftext|>
It's Tuesday and that means it's waterboarding resistance training day in SJ household
<|endoftext|>
Weird that he adheres to that when home alone
<|endoftext|>
Routine innit. The shower can be used instead of a friend
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
Rodney, prefer 1845 or 2000 for Go-Karting
<|endoftext|>
1 sec
<|endoftext|>
1845 is good
<|endoftext|>
ok 1845 then
<|endoftext|>
2 goes round will be enough anyway
<|endoftext|>
It says get there half hour before, just fyi
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
you booked yet?
<|endoftext|>
We all need to be there at 1815 and it's 50p for a racing balaclava
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney  Nope
<|endoftext|>
bout to use my card
<|endoftext|>
Changed mind?
<|endoftext|>
Joc has plenty of balaclavas
<|endoftext|>
oh sweet
<|endoftext|>
this is false
<|endoftext|>
cheers in advance
<|endoftext|>
Joc has a small cock
<|endoftext|>
also false
<|endoftext|>
Nice
<|endoftext|>
Which time do you think is best?
<|endoftext|>
4AM
<|endoftext|>
I really feel free
<|endoftext|>
Nobody around
<|endoftext|>
It's exhilarating
<|endoftext|>
Oh you meant for karting
<|endoftext|>
good for catching up on sleep
<|endoftext|>
1815/1845 to about 2000 for 2 races
<|endoftext|>
1930/2000 to about 2130 for 3 races
<|endoftext|>
Up to you
<|endoftext|>
1845 is good i guess
<|endoftext|>
ok ill pay now
<|endoftext|>
Be sure to collect my debt from Josch
<|endoftext|>
He promised
<|endoftext|>
i did not
<|endoftext|>
You will

I just clicked finish without adding a picture and it let me haha
<|endoftext|>
Yeah site was a little janky but I've got the confirmation email so we're good
<|endoftext|>
Dunno what you're talking about
<|endoftext|>
We all heading back to Josch's after to shoot some meth up each others ass?
<|endoftext|>
Hard pass
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney You any good at go karting?
<|endoftext|>
yes
<|endoftext|>
fok
<|endoftext|>
And he weighs 35kg
<|endoftext|>
We're gonna lose
<|endoftext|>
He's 7kg of pure dick muscle, so he's very forward heavy too
<|endoftext|>
(+- 0.1)
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous Don't make me be last
<|endoftext|>
The trick is just to be flat out always and slow down by losing the back tyres on the corners
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505  You gonna play mortal shell?
<|endoftext|>
Possibly, started nier automata the other day
<|endoftext|>
It's epic timed exclusive, might wait
<|endoftext|>
oh didn't realise it was Epic
<|endoftext|>
For a year I think
<|endoftext|>
I've never poisoned anyone, but I feel like it can't be that hard to guarantee they die... Seems like everyone the Russians poison goes into a coma and survives
<|endoftext|>
Poisoned tea again
<|endoftext|>
It's a classic
<|endoftext|>
Got to give them a fighting chance or it's no fun. The Russians have a very unique sense of humour.
<|endoftext|>
Maybe coma was the aim
<|endoftext|>
Maybe
<|endoftext|>
Maybe it was just a bad stroganoff
<|endoftext|>
Tea as in the drink you northern fuck
<|endoftext|>
Lol
<|endoftext|>
Absolute scum
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous Croatia taken off the safe list üò¢ That's our plans next week ruined
<|endoftext|>
It's warm, but I'm guessing you can't wear shorts to go-carting?
<|endoftext|>
Wear what you want, they'll put you in coveralls anyway
<|endoftext|>
Mankini and a Rodney mask it is
<|endoftext|>
All know what rod's wearing :RodInTheHat:

Did you call me?
<|endoftext|>
I did not

But it looks like a Disney film

@Rodney You been making thumbnails for Netflix again? Naughty boy, ruining that French woman's career
<|endoftext|>
Sorry
<|endoftext|>
Who wrote the description? Diabolical
<|endoftext|>
(If you don't know what's going on then incognito search "Netflix Cuties")
<|endoftext|>
We don't search that around here
<|endoftext|>
:Jos2:
<|endoftext|>
It's wrong
<|endoftext|>
Why :Jos2: ? Did he write it? He does hate the French
<|endoftext|>
seen new world?
<|endoftext|>
Everyone hates the French
<|endoftext|>
The amazon game? Tbh I heard who was making it and dismissed it as an mmo cash cow, does it actually look decent?
<|endoftext|>
People on my team at work are really excited about it. Looks weird to me, unique maybe
<|endoftext|>
If you need people to play with I'll put you InTouch
<|endoftext|>
i wana try it sometime
<|endoftext|>
How much ¬£?
<|endoftext|>
49 pre order
<|endoftext|>
@Louie1505 It looks decent but its still lacking in content
<|endoftext|>
Why is that my name
<|endoftext|>
Accurate but
<|endoftext|>
ive lost track of these names

What
<|endoftext|>
Get it
<|endoftext|>
get some what?

The game looi linked above or he'll rob josch's cat

Can anyone translate that?

I'd rather eat at Subway then play that game

How much is it, out of curiosity?
<|endoftext|>

Pinned a message.
<|endoftext|>
I dislike Levi's & Van's plus hate all designer brands
<|endoftext|>
I despise Apple and Amazon, I would gladly see them burn
<|endoftext|>
Yeah this is my point
<|endoftext|>
calm down nile
<|endoftext|>
^^
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney If you're gonna spend that much on a game, make it RoR2
<|endoftext|>
We need a pro
<|endoftext|>
We need a bad boy, who's willing to bend the rules
<|endoftext|>
Fun Fact: Rodney was the inspiration for the film Bad Boys
<|endoftext|>
Smokes menthol cigarettes and puts his dick in anything with 3 GCSEs or higher
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
What a weird requirement
<|endoftext|>
How does he validate that
<|endoftext|>
Verbally
<|endoftext|>
wtf
<|endoftext|>
Very trusting
<|endoftext|>
Unfortunate, I know
<|endoftext|>
I would need to see certs
<|endoftext|>
Speaking of RoR2, wanna beat that boss @Misery ?
<|endoftext|>
I want to but I'm going out for dinner.
<|endoftext|>
With your household I hope
<|endoftext|>
And wearing one of these
<|endoftext|>
Like Buddha intended
<|endoftext|>
Don't understand how people trust a fat Deity, dude can't even look after himself
<|endoftext|>
Jesus always has like 6% body fat and sick abs
<|endoftext|>
He was Black and Jewish, what do you expect
<|endoftext|>
Worked out 6 days a week and rested on the Sabbath
<|endoftext|>
Crunches only though
<|endoftext|>
Dude always has no chest
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Have you bought RoR yet?
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
You should
<|endoftext|>
I need your help
<|endoftext|>
ill get it next week
<|endoftext|>
That doesn't help me rn though
<|endoftext|>
could try it next weekend
<|endoftext|>
What are you so busy with tonight, boy?
<|endoftext|>
How many poorly-educated white chicks are you banging?
<|endoftext|>
all of them
<|endoftext|>
Impressive
<|endoftext|>
That's one of the great ironies of being a man isn't it. Ideally you want all of these women to accept your spum but really you can only please one
<|endoftext|>
Josch learned to please three at once, they call him Salad Fingers
<|endoftext|>
Why though, sounds like a lot of effort
<|endoftext|>
I barely try to please one
<|endoftext|>
I wanna go sleep
<|endoftext|>
He has a family reputation to keep
<|endoftext|>
Phil is a wizard in the bedroom
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Giles can't get it up anymore, come on
<|endoftext|>
You wanna watch my stream until you have to go then? Laugh at my failing?
<|endoftext|>
I know @Rodney likes to watch
<|endoftext|>
I am not an enthusiast for dogging related activities;
<|endoftext|>
You can watch people fuck anywhere
<|endoftext|>
Doesn't have to be dogging
<|endoftext|>
yes, but thats somewhat closely related to dogging?
<|endoftext|>
I reckon they're separate, one is like an anonymity/risk thing and the other is a cuck-esque thing
<|endoftext|>
ahh
<|endoftext|>
That being said I have normal sex with women so I am in no way an authority
<|endoftext|>
@Tyranulous
<|endoftext|>
~fact Rodney's dad killed JFK
<|endoftext|>
Wow, Chadwick Boseman died
<|endoftext|>
Just saw, wonder how Disney will react, they're probably pissed
<|endoftext|>
Not sure if he told them that he had cancer
<|endoftext|>
His historical films always earned alot of praise, been meaning to watch some
<|endoftext|>
Yeah he was better in other stuff imo
<|endoftext|>
Walt must be beating him rn
<|endoftext|>
Recon they'll replace him? Some ret-con in Michael Jordan
<|endoftext|>
Yeah obviously, way too much money in that property
<|endoftext|>
I guess he'll die at the start of bp2 and they will CG him into the spirit world to name his successor
<|endoftext|>
They hadn't started filming that yet, out 2022
<|endoftext|>
I imagine they'll just recast him. it's not so uncommon, this is just quite high profile
<|endoftext|>
Terrance Hall comes running back to marvel and begs
<|endoftext|>
I don't think they'll just recast, they'll work it into the plot.
<|endoftext|>
Terrence Howard? He quit acting or whatever
<|endoftext|>
https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2019-09-12/terrence-howard-done-with-acting
<|endoftext|>
Oh yeah Howard
<|endoftext|>
Oxford scouted him for his maths theories
<|endoftext|>
Just restored my neighbours power for her, I'm a fucking hero and a samaritan
<|endoftext|>
He says as he hides the wire cutters from last night's drunken escapade
<|endoftext|>
Nah he just went to the box and flipped the breaker
<|endoftext|>
But the question is, did it flip her switch?
<|endoftext|>
> Nah he just went to the box and flipped the breaker You are correct
<|endoftext|>
> But the question is, did it flip her switch? She came immediately
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
The Samsung one on clearance looks ok
<|endoftext|>
yea. That one is pretty good
<|endoftext|>
Rodney has spoken. Buying it now ü¶â
<|endoftext|>
not in stock üò¶
<|endoftext|>
He told you to buy it then bought them out, just to fuck with you
<|endoftext|>
:shockedPikachu:
<|endoftext|>
He's a naughty boy
<|endoftext|>
Got: https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8173616?clickSR=slp:term:monitor:8:305:1
<|endoftext|>
Have to get the train to Warrington to pick it up though
<|endoftext|>
Why would you not just order one on amazon
<|endoftext|>
Cheaper and they bring it to you
<|endoftext|>
Getting in for free from work, gotta order on Argos
<|endoftext|>
Anti-competitive behaviour, you should sue them
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney did you know she had a bf?
<|endoftext|>
who?
<|endoftext|>
what?
<|endoftext|>
Who do you think
<|endoftext|>
oh.
<|endoftext|>
i thought it was over
<|endoftext|>
Apparently it's complicated
<|endoftext|>
hmm
<|endoftext|>
Like, I don't give a fuck, was just sex - don't really want some guy getting annoyed I fucked his gf though
<|endoftext|>
Did you pull on Saturday then?
<|endoftext|>
what a chad
<|endoftext|>
Pipe down or I'll cuck you too
<|endoftext|>
Bet josch still can't sit down
<|endoftext|>
Sounds like someone wants a cucking also
<|endoftext|>
Im certain its over
<|endoftext|>
i thought it was
<|endoftext|>
Yeah she says they broke up but it's still a weird thing
<|endoftext|>
Couldn't give a fuck anyway, I got what I was after
<|endoftext|>
damn
<|endoftext|>
Don't judge me
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Why the fuck would you tell her to call me
<|endoftext|>
I don't need you managing my hook ups, we're both adults
<|endoftext|>
Neither of us think it's awkward at all, we're friends
<|endoftext|>
omg
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
told her to call you coz i dont really wana be involved in whatever
<|endoftext|>
hoe
<|endoftext|>
That's you getting involved lol. We're good, mind your own business
<|endoftext|>
rx 3090 is big
<|endoftext|>
Only a cool $1400
<|endoftext|>
> hoe Only just noticed that, fuck you
<|endoftext|>
Rodney's got claws
<|endoftext|>
Rodney's gonna get a beating if he keeps getting involved in my sex life
<|endoftext|>
Oh also @Rodney - I *asked* you first, prick
<|endoftext|>
oh. I didn't see that
<|endoftext|>
I asked you in person?
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
At courtyard, we were at the bar, remember? You said it was fine and wouldn't be weird for you
<|endoftext|>
i know thst
<|endoftext|>
ok, fuck off then lol
<|endoftext|>
All i did was say talk to lue yourself man.
<|endoftext|>
this is wierd
<|endoftext|>
It really isn't
<|endoftext|>
It's fine, we're all good, you just need to chill
<|endoftext|>
Quiet down children
<|endoftext|>
Let's not squabble
<|endoftext|>
You literally started jacking off watching us kiss on my sofa, stfu
<|endoftext|>
Small dick btw
<|endoftext|>
This is false
<|endoftext|>
Prove it
<|endoftext|>
I have tapes
<|endoftext|>
can't prove a negative
<|endoftext|>
You're negative
<|endoftext|>
Always
<|endoftext|>
a generally good thing to be
<|endoftext|>
You lot wanna go on a hike this weekend if it's nice? Can do an easy one for @Misery
<|endoftext|>
OK üò¢
<|endoftext|>
could do
<|endoftext|>
You had your chance
<|endoftext|>
Would @Rodney come if we did?
<|endoftext|>
yea. if the weather is goog
<|endoftext|>
Sunday looks alright, guess we don't need to plan anything until day of
<|endoftext|>
@Misery is being quiet, still aching from the last one?
<|endoftext|>
It's meh tbh. If everyone is going then i might aswell, but I don't have any walkin' boots
<|endoftext|>
Dunno what you were expecting other than walking, you don't cum when you reach the top
<|endoftext|>
@Rodney Seen 30xx? Feel like 2070s might have been a hasty purchase now
<|endoftext|>
3070 better than a 2080ti apparently
<|endoftext|>
yea. the 20XX dont seem to be worth it
<|endoftext|>
> 3070 better than a 2080ti apparently @Tyranulous That's standard though, right? 1070 > 980ti iirc
<|endoftext|>
2080ti was over $1200 though
<|endoftext|>
true
<|endoftext|>
Might try and sell my card for 500 lol
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
wanna buy a gpu rod?
<|endoftext|>
the 3080. YES
<|endoftext|>
3070 actually isn't a ridiculous upgrade over 2070S and those are the same price ones
<|endoftext|>
It's a good chunk but not ridiculous
<|endoftext|>
you have a 2070s?
<|endoftext|>
ya
<|endoftext|>
Think headlines are taking the biggest gaps, if you look at the whole stack it's not all that insane
<|endoftext|>
Decompressing right on the GPU is super cool though
<|endoftext|>
thats pretty cool
<|endoftext|>
No more diminishing returns on storage speed for game loads bc CPU bottleneck
<|endoftext|>
wtf is that, 8k 60fps on 3090
<|endoftext|>
60fps yea. thats huge, and a bit useless
<|endoftext|>
actually maybe good for vr
<|endoftext|>
DLSS too
<|endoftext|>
Been playing control at 1440 with RTX and DLSS/4k, does make a big difference
<|endoftext|>
it is like magic
<|endoftext|>
its weird that DLSS is a thing
<|endoftext|>
Main character's face looks great, just wish they hadn't cast such an ugly actress
<|endoftext|>
Like wtf is that
<|endoftext|>
looks a bit better in game
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
> looks a bit better in game @Rodney barely
<|endoftext|>
Ooh, The Boys this week. Might rewatch S1 before
<|endoftext|>
this week? Nice
<|endoftext|>
friday i think
<|endoftext|>
Ya
<|endoftext|>
What game are you talking about?
<|endoftext|>
Control
<|endoftext|>
Oh, the one with the telekinetic girl
<|endoftext|>
and the weird easter eggs
<|endoftext|>
yeah
<|endoftext|>
Anyone seen the david blaine special on youtube premium? Is it worth watching?
<|endoftext|>
I only watch Chris Angel magic shows
<|endoftext|>
I wanna get mindfreaked
<|endoftext|>
spend a night on canal street, you'll get mindfreaked
<|endoftext|>
Is he still at Vegas? And does anyone wanna go this weekend? My treat
<|endoftext|>
Can watch that and blue man group
<|endoftext|>
the only two acts that covid couldn't stop
<|endoftext|>
Well
<|endoftext|>
It's stopped several blue men, they just replace them
<|endoftext|>
wasn't there a smash mouth concert
<|endoftext|>
Like ever?
<|endoftext|>
during covid
<|endoftext|>
you fuck
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
They got their game on
<|endoftext|>
I only know one smash mouth song
<|endoftext|>
Whenever a blue man gets old, they take them round back of the bike shed and end them. Then hire a new blue man
<|endoftext|>
> I only know one smash mouth song @Louie1505  I'd be worried for your sanity if you knew more
<|endoftext|>
It's like people who can name more than 2 alien ant farm songs
<|endoftext|>
Those people kill people
<|endoftext|>
> Whenever a blue man gets old, they take them round back of the bike shed and end them. Then hire a new blue man @Misery Probably isn't that far from the truth tbh lol
<|endoftext|>
Is that why #bluelivesmatter was trending the other day???
<|endoftext|>
Yes
<|endoftext|>
(nobody tell him)
<|endoftext|>
Forgot how hot the forced BJ scene is
<|endoftext|>
Local lockdown extended üò¢

<|endoftext|>
Sounds like she's sub letting
<|endoftext|>
Dodgy
<|endoftext|>
Great suggestions
<|endoftext|>
Alot of the adverts on the site are people who leased for like X amount of time and are leaving before it's finished, so the landlord will let them leave if they offer replacement tenants
<|endoftext|>
Yeah you defo don't want that lol
<|endoftext|>
not protected by any tenancy laws bc you're just paying some pricks to stay in their apartment
<|endoftext|>
Ik, I'd back out if I was paying them and not the actual landlord
<|endoftext|>
Yeah, you want a proper tenancy agreement and a third party holding your deposit etc
<|endoftext|>
Potential Buddy Ups looks like Rodney's Tinder matches

Jack off whilst crying

I've seen some gameplay on twitch. Im not soo sure about the game anymore
<|endoftext|>
It'll need like a year of updates to get good
<|endoftext|>
definitely. The skill trees are a bit empty too
<|endoftext|>
But the base game looks ok, combat is refreshing for an mmo
<|endoftext|>
Shame it's only 50 v 50 guild combat
<|endoftext|>
Plus there was no raids/bosses

Wonder what they'll do for raids, it's the main draw to most MMOs

Fun fact that I just noticed by accident - Amazon use this same image for all of their logos and stuff and just make the div the size of one and then position the image so you can only see one of them https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Now/icons/browser/050317/pn-browser-sprite-uk.png

that's soo dumb
<|endoftext|>
Just had my potential roommate pull out. Been out to view that property in Ancoats on the canal, it's all above board and bloody lovely. ffs
<|endoftext|>
It was only 500 rent and 100 bills pp pm
<|endoftext|>
Should have moved in with Rod, he never pulls out
<|endoftext|>
I'd move in with the anyone at this point
<|endoftext|>
1 beds are like 150 more a month on average
<|endoftext|>
The place was 5 mins from NQ, on the canal, next to a nice little green space, next to a Coop, modern, great priced, gym included ect ect
<|endoftext|>
Could pay more and start looking for something that pays better maybe, got a decent amount of experience at that job to put on a cv now
<|endoftext|>
Yeah I plan on changing jobs soon but regardless I don't wanna pay more then 700 a month. I've found some nice places near Victoria but that place was just in a great location - I didn't feel like I was in the city centre, it was open and green
<|endoftext|>
Know plenty of people who pay more than that with roommates tbh, Centre is expensive generally

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Yeah think it was at last E3 or Game Awards or something
<|endoftext|>
Or maybe just leaked, defo rings a bell
<|endoftext|>
VaatiVidya says it was leaked last year
<|endoftext|>
Vaati knows all
<|endoftext|>
Some games
<|endoftext|>
that looks good
<|endoftext|>
The princes bride?
<|endoftext|>
Yeah the demon souls trailer looked beautiful
<|endoftext|>
they played through the tutorial
<|endoftext|>
Demon's Souls had better fucking come to PC
<|endoftext|>
No release date or anything when trailer ended
<|endoftext|>
The team that did SotC remake appears to be soing a good job
<|endoftext|>
but Vaati says the camera is weird
<|endoftext|>
more cinematic
<|endoftext|>
Oh they're great at remakes, Bluepoint or something right?
<|endoftext|>
less focused over the sholder
<|endoftext|>
rings a bell, I only know them for SotC
<|endoftext|>
> but Vaati says the camera is weird Have you played DeS?
<|endoftext|>
> rings a bell, I only know them for SotC They did Uncharted Collection, Shadow of Colossus, and MGS2
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Same as XB
<|endoftext|>
God of War trailer now
<|endoftext|>
Oh wait isn't Series S 100 cheaper
<|endoftext|>
Series X is 499 I think
<|endoftext|>
oh, no actual trailer
<|endoftext|>
Yeah undercut by 100
<|endoftext|>
lol
<|endoftext|>
MicroSoft gonna be very soft tonight
<|endoftext|>
?
<|endoftext|>
Series S is cheaper
<|endoftext|>
but its weaker
<|endoftext|>
¬£150 weaker?
<|endoftext|>
lower performance
<|endoftext|>
Oh is the digital PS5 literally just a PS5 with no disk drive?
<|endoftext|>
yup
<|endoftext|>
Ah
<|endoftext|>
weird that its that much cheaper
<|endoftext|>
must be banking on more revenue from digital
<|endoftext|>
Or the all access thing
<|endoftext|>
Trying to convert people away from disks
<|endoftext|>
ween them off
<|endoftext|>
I miss cartridges
<|endoftext|>
Who remembers the Sonic 2 cartridge where you could stack the Sonic and Knuckles one in so you could play as Knuckles in Sonic 2? Good times ‚ù§Ô∏è
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
Sorry, you were probs too busy with violin lessons
<|endoftext|>
Some of us were cool
<|endoftext|>
On the official youtube trailer
<|endoftext|>
What does that even mean
<|endoftext|>
It's coming everywhere
<|endoftext|>
Won't be on Xbox ever
<|endoftext|>
I think that means exclusive to PS5 for a time then on PS4
<|endoftext|>
We atleast it's on PC for you
<|endoftext|>
Maybe
<|endoftext|>
It does say exclusive
<|endoftext|>
It says:
<|endoftext|>
But it says exclusive lol
<|endoftext|>
Those contradict
<|endoftext|>
Other games from the conference are also coming to PC
<|endoftext|>
They don't seem to actually mean exclusive
<|endoftext|>
Just not on xbox and switch for x amount of time
<|endoftext|>
Yeah that's not what that word means
<|endoftext|>
Damn Japanese
<|endoftext|>
yup
<|endoftext|>
Glad stuff's on PC though, what else are we getting?
<|endoftext|>
Launch title???
<|endoftext|>
Vaatia says launch title
<|endoftext|>
some exec tweeted
<|endoftext|>
For DeS?
<|endoftext|>
Yep
<|endoftext|>
Yeah wouldn't surprise me, it was one of the biggest early PS3 games
<|endoftext|>
Oh yeah 1 month until Cyberpunk gets delayed again. Who's excited?

Oooh, just found out one of the seniors has been secretly tweaking all our code when he QAs it when he feels like it and sneaking it in as part of the merge so it looks like it's what we wrote originally. Only noticed bc he broke something lol. Drama
<|endoftext|>
er what lol
<|endoftext|>
So whenever anyone makes a code change it's done in a branch and reviewed then merged into where it needs to be. When you merge the same file in git you have to manually resolve the conflict by just editing the file and telling it what to keep
<|endoftext|>
Any changes you make then just go in as being part of that merge so there's basically no way of telling if it was in the branch or not unless you go look
<|endoftext|>
So he's been opportunistically tweaking our code that he 'doesn't like' and then committing it in such a way that it looks like we wrote it
<|endoftext|>
Oh without anyone reviewing his change too lol bc it looks like he's just merged it. Dunno what he was thinking
<|endoftext|>
More just confused why anyone would think that‚Äôs a good idea
<|endoftext|>
I wonder if it‚Äôs had a net positive or negative impact on code quality though
<|endoftext|>
More about risk/reward tbh - He's changing working code with something that will never be tested/reviewed purely because he dislikes it
<|endoftext|>
Still annoyed, really pissed me off, found a bunch of examples from my most recent project when I had a look
<|endoftext|>
Weird

‚ÄúEverything is so fucking expensive nowadays. A kick in the balls will set you back an arm and a leg. Let that sink in for a second. One kick in the balls. A minute of attention will set you back twelve million and forty years, which is the same cost as a year of community college. A feminist icon will look at you with admiration and grace. Unless you discount the cost of the food and the drink, the human soul is now fucking expensive. And that‚Äôs before you factor in the cost of the drugs. An ordinary person will have to shell out a trillion dollars just to gain the trust of a fluffy wookie. FUCK THAT. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm spending my life trying to rectify these spiritual cash‚ÄîCRIMES. I charge a flat fee of $849 for my largesse.

i suspect you'd have to do some amount of work to get it sanitised sufficiently
<|endoftext|>
remove names, meta data etc.
<|endoftext|>
They're complex objects in an array that you req in chunks, basically just grab messageText off each object and whack it somewhere
<|endoftext|>
Probs into a database on AELA SQL
<|endoftext|>
https://github.com/openai/gpt-2 Ew it's python
<|endoftext|>
it's not that big apparently
<|endoftext|>
someone made a google colab for it: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce#scrollTo=0wXB05bPDYxS
<|endoftext|>
Isn't that the one they trained on Reddit or whatever?
<|endoftext|>
idk was just reading this blog https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/
<|endoftext|>
I was gonna get a blank copy and train it on this. but yeah if that's the size for 124m then it won't be massive
<|endoftext|>
Pretty sure it is
<|endoftext|>
what would probably work best is to use a somewhat trained network, then do the last bit with chat data, just so it doesn't need to learn all the syntax of english etc directly from discord
<|endoftext|>
This is true
<|endoftext|>
Getting a balance would be hard
<|endoftext|>
I suspect if you trained it directly the output would be rather nonsensical
<|endoftext|>
just wack up the training cost function relative to the already trained outputs
<|endoftext|>
Yeah I guess. Might actually have a go later, see how this afternoon goes
<|endoftext|>
You can still get onto the box right?
<|endoftext|>
maybe?
<|endoftext|>
Good enough for me
<|endoftext|>
whats your domain again?
<|endoftext|>
Eh? For the VPN?
<|endoftext|>
Think you pinned everything in pm
<|endoftext|>
not in pins but have it on lastpass
<|endoftext|>
unrelated, I recommend not looking in pins if you're around people
<|endoftext|>
Yeah I was about to check but thought better of it
<|endoftext|>
Pins in our chat I meant, it's there
<|endoftext|>
i meant our chat too...
<|endoftext|>
only username password not the address as far as i could see
<|endoftext|>
doesn't matter anyway
<|endoftext|>
Further up, towards the dogging video
<|endoftext|>
ah so it is
<|endoftext|>
You rewatch it too?
<|endoftext|>
I did and I'm at my desk
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
and why
<|endoftext|>
It's pleasant entertainment
<|endoftext|>
no
<|endoftext|>
It arouses me
<|endoftext|>
Hmmmm
<|endoftext|>
No that just angers me
<|endoftext|>
Fucking cones everywhere but my road still has roadworks
<|endoftext|>

Fun Fact: Rodney's ability to go from flaccid to erect at a moment's notice was granted to him from God as a reward for his parents dilligently spreading ground rhino horn on him as a baby.

People who beep at you for not driving into a blocked yellow box when a light goes green should actually be shot
<|endoftext|>
You did a really bad job of censoring that url
<|endoftext|>
Was just trying, lazily, to occlude unnecessary information, not censor
<|endoftext|>

That seems like a very singular fetish
<|endoftext|>
Lol, Trump got the rona
<|endoftext|>
Serves him right tbh
<|endoftext|>
If only he'd not turned mask wearing into a partisan issue...
<|endoftext|>
True. Everywhere's politicised it tbh, so shit
<|endoftext|>
@everyone Games and binge drinking later?
<|endoftext|>
Going pub today
<|endoftext|>
Boris is displeased with you
<|endoftext|>
I thought he wants us to do that
<|endoftext|>
just not after 10
<|endoftext|>
Boris thinks you suck dick and that you're poor
<|endoftext|>
Boris hates cat emojis
<|endoftext|>
so do I
<|endoftext|>
THis is a lie
